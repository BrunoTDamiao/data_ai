2017-04-15,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"After being determined to be XXXX by the Dept of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) effective XX/XX/XXXX, I stumbled upon the fact that the law authorized me to apply for a discharge of my student loans ( FFEL Consolidated Loans ; originated on XX/XX/XXXX ). I made that application to XXXX of the Dept of Education on XX/XX/XXXX and it was approved as XXXX, by XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX. From there it went, supposedly to the Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority ( UHEAA ) for further processing. I was notified in XX/XX/XXXX that I would receive a check for {$4000.00} for my effective date of XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. The first scam I noted was that the XX/XX/XXXX date was changed to XX/XX/XXXX because I had made my monthly {$170.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called UHEAA they found the VA paperwork of XX/XX/XXXX stating that the "" ... VA verifies my effective date of XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX '' and told me to call back. The UHEAA employee I had talked to and who had found the official VA letter was n't able to verify that anything could be done to correct any possible mistakes since XXXX 's computer data showed the effective date of my XXXX to be XX/XX/XXXX ( Note XX/XX/XXXX and NOT XX/XX/XXXX ). Where XXXX got this date is beyond my comprehension. I called XXXX and talked to one XXXX ( twice I talked to the same XXXX ) and this nasty and mean employee of XXXX refused to offer me any assistance since all the paperwork had been forwarded to UHEAA for processing and there was nothing she could do to clear up XXXX 's XXXX on my effective date. She wanted me to quit calling and hung up. I then sent email 's to both XXXX and UHEAA with the copies of the pertinent VA letter ( s ). Yesterday I received from UHEAA letters stating that they 've received my XXXX application and it appears to be proper and they were going to forward the paperwork to XXXX for further processing. This entire process I have endured has caused me mental anguish which plays upon my "" panic attacks '' and these attacks are part and partial of my XXXX. I hate to be considered a whiner but this bureaucratic attack on my intellect and my XXXX is willful and absolutely unnecessary. XXXX and UHEAA appear to be in a collusion to deny any ex-student large portions of the funds that are due the veteran/ex-student for over payment. I have, on hand, records of all my personal checks and/or the dates of the automatic payments made to UHEAA as the collection point for the consolidated loans and the difference between what they sent me in a check ( {$4000.00} ) and what I actually paid is over {$11000.00} for I paid over {$15000.00} from XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX ( I am missing about 6 months of payment records but can easily acquire them from the bank ). This form of emotional abuse heaped upon me by XXXX and UHEAA is a knowing and intentional conduct directed at me, a vulnerable adult, resulting in my suffering mental anguish, emotional distress, degradation, and confusion. I can see how easy it can be for a bureaucrat of either agency to make a tidy sum through the years cheating a student by "" mistakenly '' withholding portions of the funds due the student for over payment and that portion is paid to the bureaucrat ( s ) rather than the student.

2017-04-13,Debt collection,Mortgage,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt was discharged in bankruptcy,XX/XX/2011 I filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy which included a past due amount on my mortgage. I continued to pay my current payments and also my trustee who paid on the arrears that was supplied to my attorney. During the bankruptcy the lender tried to increase my monthly payment by almost {$900.00}. I continued to pay the same amount I had been according to my attorney 's advice. The lender filed a post petition stating I was not in compliance with the bankruptcy and tried to get it dismissed. At the end of the bankruptcy the lender claimed I owed {$9400.00} but had no idea where that amount came from. The judge determined I pay a final cure amount of {$960.00} which I did and my bankruptcy was discharged. Shortly after the discharge I received information the lender was claiming I was over {$10000.00} in the arrears I contacted them regarding the discharge and they said the previous company that was managing my account had made an error. They were suppose to send me a letter telling me how they resolved the issue. Now a year after the discharge they are saying I am over {$8000.00} in the arrears even though they show I have made all my payments. The problem is that the current payments are being applied to months that were discharged in my bankruptcy. This is the second time I have had to contact them regarding their misapplication of payments and they just do n't fix the problem.

2017-04-10,Debt collection,I do not know,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt resulted from identity theft,"To Whom It May Concern : Approximately 4 months ago I noticed XXXX accounts listed on my credit. I advised the company who listed the accounts that the accounts are not mine and did not belong to me. I did this via letter sent USPS on two occasions both mailed correspondence included the partial account numbers and my Social Security number in order to allow the company to effectively identify the accounts. Even after sending the notice of dispute and C & D notice to the address the accounts remained on my credit. Additionally the Collection Agency continued listing the account without even notating the account that it was/is in dispute. I assumed after sending the letters in that they would be removed from my credit. I later applied for a loan which I was denied for on the spot. The loan officer sighted the XXXX recent collection accounts as the reason for the denial ( I had no other collections and or past due accounts on my credit at that time ). Once I was informed the accounts were still there I contacted your company via telephone upon doing so I was directed to leave a voicemail. I did so and my call was quickly returned as I threatened suit against your company. The woman who returned my call spoke in a manner that was extremely rude and condescending. In doing so she did advise these accounts were opened out of state by a woman. The accounts were not even in my name. She advised that she would request the accounts to be immediately removed but refused any further settlement to resolve the matter. This in itself was a violation of UDAAP, FCRA, CT Unfair Trade Practices Act and FDCPA. Your company knowingly and willfully continued reporting an account that was not my own without any investigation. I received no response to either dispute letter and was denied credit as a result of your companies negligence. Then when I afforded your company the opportunity to correct the injustice I was treated like I was garbage and talked down to as if I had no idea what I was talking about. I have consulted an attorney though I have not retained them on this matter as of yet. I have previously worked with the firm XXXX XXXX and that is why I consulted with them. XXXX XXXX advised this case would generally settle for roughly $ 10,000+ plus attorney 's fees and cost which would be paid by your company. I advised XXXX XXXX I was going to allow your company to freely correct this issue and settle this matter without going through the judicial process if your company was willing to which he advised against. In any event that is what I am willing to do to save from the lengthy drawn out process and extreme cost that would result for your offices.

ECMC does not provide "" Attachment A '' to the letter. The letter states, "" See Attachment A for a list of your loans subject to administrative wage garnishment. '' Without being properly served, I can not respond appropriately to this letter. However, I suspect that this relates to an issue that I have been continuously dealing with since XX/XX/XXXX when I sent ECMC a "" Cease and Desist '' after they improperly contacted my employer multiple times. Since that time, I have demonstrated how I paid for my education ( which I did not have the burden to do ), and I have filed complaints with the FTC, CFPB, California State Attorney General, two Senators and my local police. ECMC previously attempted to utilize an invalid document to attempt to claim that I have a student loan. The document did not have my signature, listed fraudulent information, and did not have the name of ECMC or any financial institution ( lender ) or guarantor anywhere on the form. The form was not an original, and the scan clearly reveals a form of media manipulation because the lines are not even straight. The dates are also completely inaccurate. Further, the amounts that ECMC claims far exceed the tuition for the time I attended graduate school : {$26000.00} for the entire program. It 's unfortunate that tuition has skyrocketed and outpaced inflation for the current generation, but using today 's dollar figures and attaching them to XX/XX/XXXX is just absurd. Although it is challenging to take any of this seriously, the fact is that ECMC will again go on to contact my work, and I am mired in a process in which I can not get them to leave me alone, even though I have responded to the shifted burden of proof in this country and demonstrated that I DO NOT OWE anything. The burden of proof should require debt verification and validation on ECMC 's part, but yet again, here we are with their incapability of providing a proper mailing. I have an existing "" Notice of Intent to Sue '' for the State of California, and I intend to go to court over this matter. I fundamentally believe that ECMC needs to be investigated for financial fraud.

2017-04-05,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"http : XXXX? XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX & XXXX Imagine if one notice from the federal government could cause you to question your major life decisions. 

More than half a million people may have found themselves in that situation after a new legal filing by the Education Department. 

Under a program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, some student loan borrowers were supposed to be able to have the balance of their student loans forgiven after ten years of both on-time payments and eligible work in the public sector. Meaning, a qualifying nonprofit, federal, local, state, or tribal government. 

The program started in 2007, so the first debt was set to be forgiven this coming fall. 

Last year a small group of borrowers learned that their eligibility for the program had revoked. These include four people, all attorneys, working for the XXXX, the XXXX, and XXXX. 


Student Loan Debt Has Nearly Tripled In The Last Decade NPR Ed A New Look At The Lasting Consequences Of Student Debt Nonprofits like these are not 501 ( c ) 3 charities or foundations, so it may be ambiguous whether they fall under the law 's definition of "" public service ''. But the four argued in a lawsuit last XXXX, joined by the bar association itself, that their status should n't have been revoked, certainly not retroactively. 

They had followed all the necessary steps to qualify for forgiveness. They 'd enrolled in the correct repayment program and filled out an Employment Certification Form with XXXX, which acts on behalf of the Education Department. That form certifies that borrowers work for a qualifying organization or a federal, state, tribal or city agency. It 's suggested borrowers file an ECF every year. 





On XXXX, the department responded to the suit, saying, "" XXXX XXXX 's response to the ECF does not reflect a final agency action on the borrower 's qualifications for PSLF. '' Meaning, in essence, all those years that borrowers submitted certification forms, the department was n't making any promises about forgiveness. 

Technically, the department is only responding to the narrow question about whether this small category of organizations is considered public service or not. However, "" The retroactive aspect of this filing reasonably causes people to be nervous, '' says XXXX, a senior fellow at the XXXX and a former Deputy Undersecretary of Education under Obama, where he was responsible for overseeing the program during its early years. 

Nervous is right. More than half a million borrowers have signed up for the program. So we put the word out to find out how they were feeling. We heard "" frightened, '' "" anxious, '' "" uncertainty, '' "" regret, '' "" betrayed. '' XXXX, who works for a nonprofit providing legal services to the elderly in XXXX, Idaho, has about {$80000.00} in debt. Like many borrowers, she told us, "" A lot of my life-planning decisions were made factoring the loan forgiveness into the equation. '' She says she turned down higher-paying jobs in the private sector, for example. "" I would feel very betrayed, for both myself and my XXXX sons, if this program is taken away, '' she says. "" I would likely end up paying on my loans until I was in my XXXX and would have no ability to save for retirement or to help pay for my children 's college. '' XXXX is a parole officer in Texas with about {$30000.00} in loans. "" It 's horrible, '' he writes, "" because I was really depending on that to move on with my life and I do n't know what I 'm going to do.

2017-03-16,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt was discharged in bankruptcy,"We were clients of a XXXX hard line telephone service for ( 40 years ) and Internet service providers for over 12+ years. We no longer wanted a hard line phone as we did n't use it, it was a total annoyance, and my wife and I both had mobile phones. 
I got in touch with XXXX and explained to them my desire to discontinue our telephone service. ( I 've had this telephone for over 40 years. ) XXXX said that they could remove the phone line but they would only credit our monthly service bill for only {$4.00}. Our bills indicated that XXXX was charging us {$30.00} per month for just the telephone service. Due to length of time we were clients, we were no longer under any kind of service contract with them. We decided that XXXX was only interested in bilking us for service we no longer wanted or needed. They were also providing us with a very slow internet speed, a service they no longer, in fact, provided to new clients because, "" It was too slow ''. My wife and I decided that it was time to leave XXXX because we no longer felt they were being ethical or reasonable in their business dealings with us. We found another XXXX who would provide excellent service, at a charge far less than XXXX, and treat us with respect and honesty. We ceased using XXXX services on XX/XX/2017. 
I called XXXX to discontinue service with them and return their modem, which I did immediately. At the very end of my conversation with the service representative to close our account he told me that XXXX would charge us {$150.00}. for a disconnection fee. I have been with the company for over 12+ years, we did not have a current service contract with XXXX , nor any written or verbal agreement that there would be any disconnection fees applied to us whatsoever. I asked XXXX to provide proof of this "" contract ''. They never provided proof of a contract as they promised to do. Is this their way of conducting business with long-term clients? 
XXXX followed up by only sending us a non-itemized bill in an attempt to bury this fraudulent charge inside our final bill, without ever providing us with any proof of our responsibility for such a contract charge. They are not being ethical in dealing with us. 
They have not sent the proof we requested, but instead have turned the matter over to a collection agency. We absolutely dispute that after over 12 years service we were still under a "" contract ''. This is a false claim on their part. Plus they are not furnishing us with a bill that itemizes and dates all charges. I find this a rather unsavory way to conduct business, especially with a long-term client. 
Yesterday, we received a letter from a collection agency working for XXXX without any itemization or explanation of charges. Just a final bill amount, without any documentation, nor "" proof '' of a "" contract '' which XXXX claims we had, but will not show us. How can we know what we are being charged for? We were also informed by a XXXX telephone agent over 6 months ago that we were "" no longer under any contract with them currently ''. 

How do we go about having this {$150.00}. unsubstantiated charge for disconnection by XXXX dismissed? XXXX refuses to deal with this matter in a civilized way. 
They are demanding payment for something that they have not provided evidence of. This is unprofessional and arrogant on their part. We have always dealt with them in an ethical manner, they are not responding in kind. 
In my research on XXXX on the web I 've noticed that XXXX has a multitude of lawsuits against them for their poor business practices all over the USA.

Also, I have had a utility terminated due to this, as well as another utility suspended. I contacted my former credit union, to receive a contact number for this bill payment service. Upon contacting this company, the call suddenly terminates without my speaking to anyone in regards to this matter. I had a bill payment service approve payments while there are insufficient funds in one 's account. I have also attached proof some payments were attempted more than twice. According to credit card companies, when a payment is returned, that payment is applied to the balance, unless otherwise instructed. I did not interfere with the processing of the credit card payment. I was informed by the credit card company, a notation was placed on the payment, therefore causing the card to become late on my credit files. Furthermore, this company has not mailed me at my mailing address, in regards to this matter. I have provided notes from a conversation with XXXX XXXX, in regards to what was to happen if a payment is returned. Also, I have included verification of the Direct Deposit that was intended for my credit union for XX/XX/XXXX. Also, the address the credit union, as well as the USPS, and the Department of Veteran Affairs, as of XX/XX/XXXX. Also, I only received notification of this alleged debt after receiving a phone call from this company, on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested a letter be mailed to me in regards to this matter. I never received such letter. As I was contacted less than 21 days after the payment was allegedly made, there was no attempt to resolve this matter within the credit union. I was not allocated the full thirty calendar days to dispute this alleged debt. as it has been now over sixty calendar days, and I still have not received formal notice by postal mail, this alleged debt is hereby invalid. As you mentioned in your previous answer to the CFPB, my address was considered as "" invalid '', according to your company. As an alleged collector of debts, my address could have been obtained by contacting the credit union itself or by conducting "" skip tracing '' with the credit bureaus. Also, I find it rather perplexing how you had an invalid address when you contacted me via telephone. I also informed you of the correct mailing address per our telephone conversation on XX/XX/XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

Bank of America is an extremely dishonest organization. I say that because I have more than provided proof that I did not apply for a card. I want to start off by saying after discovering this fraudulent debt, I contacted Bank of America and provided them my address in which I have been at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX almost 10 years. Meaning this is where I was when they claim they sent a card, ask Bank of America, where did they send a credit card to? I have sent them a copy of my property taxes which shows the date I moved in. The time that they state they issued a card it was not sent to my address, review the application. This is the address in which I was located at when the card was issued. If they look at the information on their application, it does not match my address and they know that. Next they indicated, that I signed the application, I never signed a application, did Bank of America see me sign an application, no, nor have I seen an application. Next, they indicated that XXXX my daughter and I shared a bank account in which payments where paid from. Please send the checks or what ever payments were made as I never authorized any payments to the organization, we never shared an account. Then I sent them a letter from XXXX in which they indicated they transferred funding to a XXXX account. When I sent them the document from XXXX indicating the account in which they indicated funds where transferred to was a fraudulent account, Bank of America is indicating that the XXXX letter was referring to a lease when that is a lie, the XXXX letter was indeed a letter in reference to a fraudulent credit card in which they stated about transferring funds to. I have produced documents to show my residence at the time of this credit card. I was not living at the address in which they have. I showed my voter 's registration card to also confirm my address at the time of this card. I have given them a letter from XXXX in which Bank of America lied stating it was a letter for a lease it is not. Please provide me a letter from them so I can sue you and XXXX if they told you that lie. I inquired as to why I was not contacted before issuing credit, because I have had a fraud alert for numerous years including the period of the issuance of this card, they would have been aware I did not apply. Then I have also sent a copy of my XXXX mortgage document, which showed my previous address of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX address which was the address prior to my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Residence.

I chose XXXX Mortgage and they have shared and sold this acct to several other companies. After falsifying documents and violating TN codes and statutes. Being that they have violated the laws to alter the the deed of trust the document can not be attached to the existing acct. The company claiming possession of the acct with a new acct number is LOANCARE. Once I received notice that the acct had been transferred and a new acct number created I contacted them before the first payment was due. I received a monthly statement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX on or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX from Loancare before receiving notice from them that they were in possession of the account. Which was on or about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The notice of transfer was dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I contacted the company XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and asked for a payoff statement, debt validation and full disclosure to include a copy of the original wet inked signature page ( front and back ) of the promissory note. I requested these documents due to the fact the company delivered incorrect contact information and no payoff amount while on the call. I wanted to be sure they gained information honestly. Also to be sure no additional misinformation was transferred. I told them I wanted no future problems. Also to send it asap so the payment would n't be late. And informed them not to report to any agencies until they sent the requested documents. I was told the information would be sent out to me that day. The documents never came. I contacted them on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the same request and still nothing. Although they say they sent them out and acknowledged that the request was made on an earlier conversation. I was told the documents would be expedited to me by XXXX a rep. The documents never came.

I contacted them XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was routed to a dead phone line, they hung up on me. I called back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On this phone call after speaking with a collections rep and a collections supervisor it was brought to my attention that the acct was trans ferred on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and all of my calls since the beginning were routed to collections. Also the fact the collections dept could n't order documents. I spoke with a customer srvc supervisor that asked if any rep ever told me to put the request in writting. I told her no and sent the request in writting via email ( recommended by supervisor ) on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an acknowledgement email stating they would conduct a thorough investigation and reply in 5 days. Also not to resubmit as it would cause delay. They never responded.

That they had my promissory note with signature now and excuses would not stop them from enforcing collections with or without giving full disclosure.. That they intended to report to the agencies on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and they would send The Notice of default. I informed him that the Notice had already arrived.

I have firstly contacted the courts and I actually went down to the court house and tried to verify it I was able to get any information one of my questions is simple is if I could not get any info ( "" HOW COULD TRANSUNION '' ). The XXXX COURT/XXXX CA DISTRICT sent me a letter from the County Clerk 's Office stating that at no given time do they report to any of the XXXX Credit Bureaus. I also put a security freeze on all of the major data mining companies like XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and I have sent letters recently to XXXX XXXX.

I have sent a formal notice to all XXXX Credit Bureaus and made XXXX CFPB complaints concerning their verification process of XXXX, Transunion and XXXX. I am a Deputy Sheriff for over 20 years experience I want to give you an example please indulge me If I make a traffic stop and the dispatcher says that person has a bench warrant but for me I have to verify the warrant The dispatcher just looking at the screen and see the information it is not verified. She has to pull the actual warrant info with the signature of the judge. Then I can make the arrest. 

The XXXX bureaus use these data mining companies and using info on a screen that they can not be verified thru the courts the letter states that and I have put security freezes on all other entities and CB 's sometime do not give you the needed info required from the FCRA on who verified, name, phone number, name of company etc. 

I asked Transunion verification made pursuant to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Please note that I am requesting "" Verification '' that is competent evidence bearing my signature showing that I have or ever had a Bankruptcy.

1. Is it not illegal for National Credit Service to tell me they will remove it as soon as I pay it and not send me proof of that? 

2. Is it not illegal for National Credit Service to remove it after the debt was paid by agreement, then to report it back to XXXX 11 days later after it was removed? ( it made my credit score go back down ). 

3. Now we are in a battle of who has the authority to have this removed from our credit records, the XXXX or National Credit Service. We have had several debts that we have done the same thing on and they have all been removed without question.

This all started when I received a letter in the mail from Delta Management XX/XX/XXXX stating that they were attempting to collect on my XXXX defaulted student loans. My loans had defaulted due to the fact that I had been in an accident with my XXXX causing me to be out of work because I was recovering from my injuries for several months. At the time, I was an XXXX. I was no longer able to work for myself, so I lost my XXXX. During this time, my wife divorced me because I was n't making enough money for her. I had to sell our home and move because she wanted the money and then I had child support payments for XXXX children as well. I had completely lost everything that I loved and I had very little money. I also lost my car. I had to file bankruptcy and try to get back on my feet. I do apologize that I allowed my loans to go into default, but I tried to reach out for help with no avail. When the letter came from Delta Management, I called and asked how I could get my XXXX loans out of default XX/XX/XXXX. The Delta Management rep told me that I had to agree to have my payments automatically deducted from my paycheck and that after 6 months of consistent payments they will take my XXXX loans out of default. So, I agreed and also I agreed to pay 4 payments each month instead of 1 payment in the hopes that I would decrease my balance owed quicker and show my willingness to pay. However, although I have been paying voluntarily, consistently 4 payments each month since XX/XX/XXXX, I have not had my loans taken out of default. I am a military veteran and I am currently in the process of purchasing a home for myself and my new wife, but the loan officer pulled my credit report and showed me that my XXXX student loans are still on my credit report in default status. I was made aware that I can not get a VA Loan unless my loans are out of default. I have paid what I agreed to with Delta Management and am still paying, yet nothing on their end has changed. I feel that I was defrauded by Delta Management and lied to by them just to get my money. I also notice that they have been taking a large amount of each payment as interest and collection agency fees. This amounts to a lot of money as I pay them each week. Is this accurate? Is it legal for Delta Management to not take my loans out of default? I have called repeatedly since XX/XX/XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX and have been told the same thing. I have asked for a supervisor, sent written disputes through their website, sent emails through their website and also the Department of Education with no response from either. although, the website says they will respond within a few days. Also, every time I called the Department of Education Debt Resolution Dept, they told me that I had to talk too Delta Management. Please help me because I have been trying so hard to get this fixed that I am going to call and write my Senator, Governor, Congressman and President of the United States. I ca n't afford for my VA loan to be rejected. I promised my new wife that I would provide a home for us, but I ca n't do it without my Va Loan. This treatment that I received is wrong!

She sent this letter on XX/XX/XXXX, and it was received on XX/XX/XXXX ( letter attached ). She indicated that she was going to sue the employer for a "" debt '' that has already been dealt with by more than one complaint filed with the CFPB. She received immediate communication back on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, ECMC had claimed that it had retained California attorney, XXXX to defend it against FDCPA claims. XXXX office was contacted, and they continued to claim that his law firm was handling the matter and that there should n't be another attorney. Without respect to the confusion that was caused, multiple email forwards were sent to XXXX indicating that I do not have any debts owed with ECMC. She was told that she was not to contact my place of employment via certified mail, telephone, email and facsimile. She was immediately sent documents indicating that there was no Administrative Wage Garnishment in effect and that there was, therefore, no potential claim against my employer. Nevertheless, she still contacted my place of employment on XX/XX/XXXX, emailed the CEO, and spoke with the CEO twice. She then claimed that she would also be contacting the payroll company. After receiving a Cease and Desist and Notice of Intent to Sue, as well as having complaints filed with the CFPB, ECMC and its agents have contacted my workplace a minimum of an additional seven times and have contacted my former college to attempt to obtain records. Unfortunately for them, the records of the college - which have parts blacked out by either ECMC or the college - reveal that I was fraudulently classified as a law student ( I never applied to law school, and I, therefore, certainly did not attend law school ) and show that I made direct payments to them. This corresponds with my own receipts for payment, which I ordered a hard drive reader to be able to produce for their former attorney, XXXX. ECMC - under threat of lawsuit - and with direct proof of fraud, will not stop. Not only that, this situation has become much worse because my work has been contacted more times now than before I filed with the CFPB, and I have had to research additional agencies to turn to to receive assistance. This is consuming unbelievable amounts of time, and there is no way to achieve a permanent solution.

2016-12-30,Debt collection,Credit card,Disclosure verification of debt,Right to dispute notice not received,"It appears that it is AAFES practice to make it difficult for consumers to make payments to their credit card account because it is easy for them to do a Treasury Offset even if the consumer the customer was not properly notified. I say this because my account was placed under AAFES Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program initially in XXXX because AAFES placed my account in collections after they increased my monthly payments without notification then locked me out of accessing my account because I was no longer in the Military. I got out the military in XXXX XXXX and had my account on auto-pay for AAFES to withdraw {$120.00} per month ( my minimum payment each month was about {$80.00} ). I later found out that my account was over 90 days past due because AAFES had increased my payments without notifying me to {$180.00} per month ; so although my direct payments of {$120.00} was received on time every month it was still in default because of a {$60.00} shortage. No notification was received from AAFES to inform me of my new monthly payment amount, nor did AAFES ever send me any notification that my account was past due. I found out of the delinquent account after trying to obtain credit and the creditor informed me that I had a past due account. Once I found out, I attempted to access my AAFES account online and realized that I no longer had access. I called AAFES and was told that since I was no longer in the Military my access was revoked. I explained to the representative that my access was limited after I got out the Military but I was given access to view my statements and pay on my account online. The representative told me that AAFES had revised that policy and so the only way I could access my account was by paper statements. I informed the representative that I had not received any paper statements and she told me that they would send XXXX out. I then asked how could I pay my account and I was told that the only way to correct it is to pay the full balance or settle through the Voluntary Payment Plan ( VPP ) program. This program required that I call every month to pay my bills. I complied with the rules of this program every month for the past 3.5 years. When I called to pay my bill in XXXX XXXX, AAFES notified me that they were making it easier for consumers to pay their debt so I could set up auto-pay which would relieve me of calling monthly. I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments thinking that AAFES had finally gotten better. Now I 'm finding out that this was a plight to defraud me and keep me in debt once again. 

I requested to have my account set up on auto-payments where payments of {$180.00} would be debited from my bank account on the XXXX of every month. My XXXX XXXX statement showed that the money was debited as requested on the XXXX XXXX and my next withdrawal was set up for XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX after returning from a 10 day vacation out of State, I received a statement from AAFES which was postmarked XXXX XXXX, XXXX. That statement showed that my account was 30 days past due in the amount of {$180.00} ; a fee of {$25.00} was added for NSF and my XXXX XXXX payment was reversed. I immediately checked my bank statement to see what was going on and verified that there was more than enough money in my account for AAFES to electronically pull the {$180.00} payment which they reported as NSF and charged me a {$25.00} NSF fee. I immediately called AAFES to find out why they charged me a NSF fee and reversed my payment if there was more than enough funds in my account. The representative placed me on hold then came back to ask me what is my bank account number. I verified my account number with her and she told me that they had the wrong account number on file.

I immediately called Sallie Mae to discuss my hardship in hopes for a solutions due to my promptness in attempting to sort out the issue before I end up in financial trouble. 

In the first phone call Sallie Mae simply informed me that they have no options for me at this time and my only option is to default on my loans and that at that time collections may have more options for me. 

Unsatisfied with this solution, I called a second time and in that call I was told that they can offer me an interest only payment for 12 months, essentially delaying my monthly payments not adjusting the actual amount in any way. In doing this it reduces my monthly payments in total by about XXXX dollars, however, the total payment due is still not affordable. 

So at this time, they will not consolidate my XXXX loans, they will not lower my payments every month, they will not work with me to prevent going to collections and defaulting and my only option is to default on my loans to get assistance. 

I found this experience totally overwhelming and frustrating.

At no time did I speak with a XXXX person until the technician arrived to install the equipment.

Consequently, I changed the provider of my bundled services. I contacted XXXX and advised them I was cancelling my service due to the above issues.

They assured me that they would fix it and that my loan would be in that program. They did n't and they went out of business. They sold my loan to Mohela. I just found out today that I have never been put on the right kind of repayment plan. 

I have made 7 years of payments, always on time, and none of them count. I was supposed to have loan forgiveness after 10 years of on time payments. I just want credit for my 7 years, because I had no way to know or even no way to check if what I was told actually happened. Even if the total of my payments would have been more than what I did pay, I am willing to pay any additional funds that I would have paid, had they done what they said they were doing. 

I am XXXX years old, and I want to retire someday, sooner rather than later. I have very little to retire on because I was a military spouse for 20 years and had a sporadic work history, and now I work in XXXX, so the social security administration is going to cheat me out of a lot of my retirement because I get XXXX retirement for part of my work history. ( That 's another messed up financial situation that your agency should look at. ) I will probably have to buy a mobile home with money I get from my parent 's house when they pass away, just to be able to afford to live in retirement. I ca n't pay student loans in retirement. If I could discharge them in bankruptcy, I would since I feel like I have been cheated. I have always paid all of my debts. I even almost lost a house in the recession but worked really hard to sell it at a loss rather than default. I lost XXXX dollars in home-ownership in the recession, because when I sold house number XXXX, it was XXXX and I had no idea that the whole economy would tank in XXXX. I purchased a condo in XXXX and it is currently worth XXXX less that I originally paid for it. 

When I first discovered the problem with XXXX, I found evidence of XXXX Loans doing this with a lot of people, but I no longer have the information. I know it 's there and could be found with some intensive XXXX or other searching. Please help me. I have always tried to do the right thing in life, and have gotten XXXX by circumstances, but this is just wrong and seems like it should be able to be fixed, since it was a couple of people who either lied or were just too incompetent to do the job right. No one wants to take any responsibility, and I just want this corrected since I did what I was supposed to do, and have dedicated my life to XXXX.

I was asked to co-sign the student loans which I did. The loans varied in amounts - usually around {$10000.00} - and the interest rates also varied but averaged about 8 %. 

In about 2013 or so, there was public outrage over the high interest rates that college students were being charged, and so Wells Fargo contacted ME to see if I would be interested in consolidating my son 's student loans with a much lower interest rate. I said of course I would. So with the understanding that everything besides the interest rate would basically be the same - the outstanding amount, the term, and the fact that I would still be a co-signer guaranteeing the loan - I signed and returned the documents that were sent to me. 

During the early years of the loan, my son was still a student and had no source of income. So I paid the entire monthly balance myself. For about two years after he left college I continued to make the entire payments since I was the co-signer. Because I was not the student, however, I was not entitled to any income tax deduction for the amounts that I was paying. 

In the last year, my son has become employed and is now capable of making the student loan payment payments himself and receiving the income tax deductions. So I contacted Wells Fargo and asked that the request for the monthly loan payment be sent to him instead of me. I knew I would continue to the be the co-signer and guarantee the loan, but he now needed the income tax deduction for the payments he would be making. Wells Fargo responded back to me saying that when the student loan was consolidated, I agreed to be entirely responsible for the loan and that my son was no longer responsible for payment. 
I told them that I NEVER agree to be totally responsible, especially for a student loan where I was not the beneficiary ( the student ) and for which I received no income tax deduction for my payments. After discussing this with the Wells Fargo Student Loan people for several weeks, they would not budge and will not recognize my son as the legitament holder and beneficiary of the loan.

2016-09-14,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"On or about XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter submitted a loan application with Sallie Mae in the amount of $ XXXX to cover the school expenses for her trade school ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX ) that were not otherwise covered through FAFSA. On that same date, I co-sign the loan application and it was submitted back to Sallie Mae for processing. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter contacted Sallie Mae and found that her loan application was denied on the basis of the co-signer denial. I went out to the Sallie Mae site and saw the denial without explanation ; so, as instructed by their site, I contacted their Customer Service department ( XXXX XXXX ) and spoke with "" XXXX ''. He confirmed the status of the loan application denial, but could not provide an explanation because their "" process '' does not allow their Customer Service personnel from viewing said information ( Oddity # 1 ). He did put in a request through their automated system to generate an explanation letter and that I would see it within 24-48 hours. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was notified via email that the loan denial explanation was out on the Sallie Mae site in my account ( I have a previous relationship with them due to co-signing student loans for my son ). I download the explanation letter and it was the standard boiler plate denial letter without a clear reason for denial ... just listed the potential reasons. Since my credit standing is very good at this point, even better than it was when I co-signed loans with them for my son, I was very confused ; so, as instructed in their letter, I contacted their Customer Service department again. Again, the Customer Service representative could not help me, so she patched me through to the Originator Department and I spoke with "" XXXX ''. XXXX reviewed the account information ; and, as it was with the Customer Service personnel, he was unable to view the actual reason for the denial and stated that this was the process and policy per their Corporate Headquarters. He did submit a request for a full explanation letter to be sent to me via snail mail and that I would see it within the next 30 days. The problem is that my daughter 's school begins in less than 60 days and I explained I could not wait that long, but he said their was no one else he could refer me to expedite the help request. 

I believe the only reason that is causing the hiccup with this loan application is the outstanding $ XXXX in loans I 've co-sign for my son with Sallie Mae, but none of them are delinquent. I state this because my credit is very good, I have no delinquencies and I have a decent income ( $ XXXX ), plus I 'm a veteran and still currently employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 20 years XXXX XXXX, 16 years XXXX ). 

My daughter will be resubmitting her applicable using her grandfather and/or aunt to co-sign for her and those should go through with ease, but I am not satisfied with the multiple layered bureaucracy and the fact that XXXX and XXXX XXXX representatives of Sallie Mae can not assist a customer with a simple task, especially one that could possibly be resolved over the phone.

And any other collection they have placed on my credit report. 
The collection agency fraudulently put the above collections on to my credit report. I have disputed the charges. [ See exhibit XXXX ] My dispute ... Their response ; sent to me from CMRE. They have been unable to send me any bill from the institution that they say they represent. I have always maintained medical insurance. My insurance has always paid over the amount that the service was worth. If these charges are for medical services, they are 1. Fraudulent, 2. For services I did not receive, 3. Services that I did not agree to or want but I was charged anyway. There is so much fraud in the Insurance /Medical/Collection agency field ... It does so much damage to people, and their credit. 
The fraudulent billing practices of the medical institutions, and the people who work at these institutions along with the collection agencies they hire, give them the ability to extort money from the public by having all your private information which facilitates the creation of bills that go to their collection agencies like CMRE which then ruin your credit. The fraudulent actions of CMRE, are keeping me and a lot of other people from refinancing. 
See Exhibit B, Mortgage Company wants to pay CMRE, before I can refinance to a lower rate. The Mortgage Company explains it by repeating ; 'it 's the XXXX Selling guide '' that is to blame and they have to follow those guidelines. They are insisting that these accounts be paid. This demand is based on hearsay information for charges that CMRE put on my credit report. They are fraudulent, further it represents insurance fraud by the person who created this collection account, who has partnered with CMRE to get extra money from people for a service that has already been paid for by insurance or for services not rendered. These charges have not been adjudicated by going through the court, to produce a lean. 
It is unbelievable that this Company CMRE can nickel and dime Americans, they have such easy access to our Credit reports and can hold us hostage with no proof of a debt.

2016-09-07,Debt collection,Medical,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"My complaint and present-day issue involves Central Credit Services, a debt collection agency at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Missouri. Zip code : XXXX. The debt collection agency, Central Credit Services, references their account # XXXX. 

The allegation of a delinquent debt by Central Credit Services is faulty. Their agency violates sections of FDCPA, and one of those sections includes their requirement to provide "" Proper Verification of a Debt '' which is annotated within FDCPA 1692g. 

Central Credit Services mailed a debt-collection notice to me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, alleging a {$1600.00} debt as due, identifying the original creditor of the alleged debt as XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX is based in XXXX, Wisconsin. Their notice is in error. I do not owe the debt. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent a dispute letter to Central Credit Services, utilizing Priority - Return Receipt postal mail. Central Credit received my dispute letter on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I initiated a XXXX XXXX XXXX complaint against XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, disputing any debt that is allegedly due by me to XXXX XXXX, which is referenced in the Central Credit Services billing notice. The XXXX XXXX references my complaint with ID # XXXX, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX provided a written answer to my complaint on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX 's answer was directed both to me and the XXXX XXXX. XXXX 's answer to me is written, in part : "" .... XXXX XXXX will write off the balance and remove the account from collections. '' Further, XXXX 's written response to me added : "" .... We will have the collections agency send a letter to the patient ( meaning, me ) confirming the account ( s ) are CLOSED and DELETED from the ( patient 's ) CREDIT REPORT. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I sent a XXXX dispute letter to Central Credit Services, and referenced XXXX XXXX 's answer to my complaint and assertion that no debt is due to XXXX XXXX. My XXXX correspondence to XXXX XXXX was sent by Priority Certified - Receipt postal mail. XXXX XXXX received my XXXX correspondence on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

This entire issue originated with a Debt Buyer, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The original ( alleged ) debt buyer, XXXX, had sold XXXX alleged debts of {$810.00} each to a debt collection agency known as XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Both of those alleged debts, referencing XXXX XXXX, were disputed by me with XXXX in timely correspondence dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

While XXXX XXXX is vague about how these alleged Medical debts have ever surfaced, it appears that either XXXX XXXX or an affiliate Hospital erred in sending their own billings to the Veterans ' Administration -- which had later paid Medical Billings in my behalf. In any event, there is NOT DEBT DUE TO XXXX XXXX. Indeed, XXXX XXXX has now confirmed it, ( finally ), and provided written correspondence to me and the XXXX XXXX 

Central Credit Services violates law if continuing to collect this alleged debt. It is necessary that Central Credit Services provide correspondence to me, indicating their acknowledgement that this matter is closed with no debt due to the ( alleged ) original creditor -- XXXX XXXX.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Radius Global Solutions LLC,WI,549XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,09/07/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2099771

I sent this organization a "" Cease and Desist. '' They then contacted my workplace and spoke with the Administrative Assistant for my department. They attempted to obtain personal information about me from her. She provided me with their contact information. I called them again to state that they needed to stop. They said they would not talk to me unless I provided them with my Social Security Number and Date of Birth. Without receiving a single document from them, a "" Notice Prior to Wage Withholding '' was sent to the Payroll division of my place of employment. The Payroll Officer provided me with this document. In response, on XXXX XXXX, 2016, I sent them a letter indicating that their actions are illegal. My place of employment said that they then received a notice to stop the wage garnishment. I thought that that was the end of this matter with Delta Management Associates , Inc . They have provided no debt validation, claiming that they can not do so unless I give them my Social Security Number and Date of Birth over the telephone. I have requested that they verify the existence of this debt, which is not listed on my credit, and which I did not enter into with any organization.

XXXX broke our contract based on XXXX issues. I rightfully terminated our former agreement for non-performance. Thereafter, XXXX tried to use debt collection agencies to enforce early contract termination fees. Debt is defined as a promise of future payment owed for goods and/or services rendered. 

Early termination fees of a contract agreement rightfully discontinue is a contract dispute not debt for services or goods provided. This is a civil matter not a collection matter. There is no court order. XXXX XXXX is trying to use the debt collection process as a means of extortion rather than hiring an attorney and taking the matter to court which is their legal right and where the issue belongs. I believe they are using this method because they understand they have no legal position. 

Thereafter XXXX XXXX hires a collection agency. The collection agency writes me notice I respond with proof of service and deny any debt. The collection agency quits and XXXX XXXX hires another collection agency. Again, I respond with proof of service and deny any debt. The collection agency quits and XXXX XXXX hires another collection agency. This goes on 6 times. I have attached all correspondence and proof of delivery to each. 

It appears in the middle of this process XXXX XXXX increase the amount owed and changes the account number.

I am XXXX years of age. My business of over 40 years began bringing in less and less money, starting in XXXX, because it is dependent upon the XXXX. The XXXX was in a downward spiral at that time and is just now coming out of its decline. We took on more debt than we ever had before, just to keep things going. 

My wife had always handled the finances, ran the household, cleaned the house, did the laundry, shopping, cooking, etc., and, in general, took care of our XXXX XXXX dogs, me and everything else. She also worked for the my business doing reports, which were very time consuming, but she did them quickly. Unfortunately, my wife was stricken with XXXX XXXX, which affects people in different ways. My wife mainly has XXXX, all of which are so severe that she sometimes can not get into or out of bed, or put on all of her clothes, by herself. So, whenever necessary, I help her with whatever she needs. I also try to do the household things my wife used to do, but am falling very short of that. In addition, I do not do "" the time consuming reports quickly. '' In fact, sometimes they seem to take me forever with all of the interruptions and additional things I am now responsible for. I am trying to deal with my situation, but it really is dire. 

Further, money is so tight that we can not afford to eat healthy. When a company demands a large payment with the threat that they will charge off our bill if I do not pay it, our "" food money '' is the only place to take the funds from. I was re just asking for some time and consideration. As I said above, I had a credit card with Home Depot and I got behind on my payments. I should also mention that I had XXXX other credit cards, and other assorted bills, and I got behind in my payments on all of them, as well. 

I usually pay my bills by telephone, so each time I called Home Depot Credit Services to pay my bill, I received a lecture about my payment being late, at which time I would again explain my situation..

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I paid Citibank {$50.00}, on XXXX XXXX, I paid {$160.00}, which included the money we needed to buy food. I supposedly had to pay that amount to keep them from charging it off.

My civilian job has been very helpful and has worked well with me and my family with the transitions, up until this point, that is. The attached documentation is in chronological order and I will try to explain it in this letter in the same manner. 
The first letter I received was dated XXXX XXXX XXXX and it is telling me I have a debit of {$1700.00} in unpaid health insurance. I elected to pay for and maintain my civilian coverage while on XXXX XXXX to allow my family to keep our same providers and use my military insurance as secondary coverage. It states in the letter that my payments are scheduled to be taken out of my check and that I would maintain the pretax benefit with that. I elected to let that procedure take place as outlined in the letter. I was back at the XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX ; I then went on XXXX XXXX for two more weeks from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then returned to the XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX and stayed there until I was activated on the orders that I am on now ; XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
In XXXX XXXX I received the attached letter from the Treasury Dept. that stated I owed {$660.00} and listed a website and a telephone number. The website seemed suspect to me and was asking for all my personal information, so I called the phone number on the letter and left messages there, with no response. The letter also stated on the top my debit was {$660.00}, but at the bottom payment coupon it says I owe {$850.00}. I contacted my supervisor at the XXXX and he contacted XXXX of the XXXX personnel that are located in XXXX. They both advised me to wait until they checked it out to make sure it was legitimate. 
Next, I received a phone call on my cell phone from Pioneer Credit Recovery Inc. asking if I was XXXX XXXX, what was my birthdate, address and last XXXX of my SS. Of course I was very wary of answering, but then he told me my last XXXX! He wanted me to send them a copy of my orders and I told him the XXXX had copies of my orders and if they sent him to me, they can give him copies of my orders. This is what rekindled my efforts at finding out what is going on, so I contacted my XXXX Supervisor, and the XXXX person. XXXX sent me the information attached dated XXXX XXXX that outlined my medical insurance payments and what is still due. On page XXXX it states I owe a principle of {$630.00}, interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00}. After I obtained this information I mailed a {$500.00} check to the XXXX in XXXX XXXX with the attached XXXX XXXX XXXX letter. I have also attached an image of the cancelled check for {$500.00}. I will mail them the remaining amount when I find out if I am liable for the full amount. This brings me to XXXX of my questions ; Am I responsible for the interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00} or does the XXXX allow for these charges to be waived because they were incurred while I was on military duty and they are trying to be collected while I am again on military duty?

I 'm a member of the Hawaii XXXX XXXX XXXX and have been XXXX for military XXXX of various time lengths in the last couple of years. My civilian job has been very helpful and has worked well with me and my family with the transitions, up until this point, that is. The attached documentation is in chronological order and I will try to explain it in this letter in the same manner. 
The first letter I received was dated XX/XX/XXXX and it is telling me I have a debit of {$1700.00} in unpaid health insurance. I elected to pay for and maintain my civilian coverage while on XXXX XXXX to allow my family to keep our same providers and use my military insurance as secondary coverage. It states in the letter that my payments are scheduled to be taken out of my check and that I would maintain the pretax benefit with that. I elected to let that procedure take place as outlined in the letter. I was back at the USDA from XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ; I then went on XXXX XXXX for XXXX more weeks from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. I then returned to the USDA on XXXX XXXX XXXX and stayed there until I was activated on the orders that I am on now ; XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I received the attached letter from the Treasury Dept. that stated I owed {$660.00} and listed a website and a telephone number. The website seemed suspect to me and was asking for all my personal information, so I called the phone number on the letter and left messages there, with no response. The letter also stated on the top my debit was {$660.00}, but at the bottom payment coupon it says I owe {$850.00}. I contacted my supervisor at the USDA and he contacted one of the USDA PR personnel that are located in XXXX. They both advised me to wait until they checked it out to make sure it was legitimate. 
Next, I received a phone call on my cell phone from Pioneer Credit (? ) asking if I was who I am, what was my birthdate, address and last XXXX of my SS. Of course I was very wary of answering, but then he told me my last XXXX! He wanted me to send them a copy of my orders and I told him the USDA had copies of my orders and if they sent him to me, they can give him copies of my orders. This is what rekindled my efforts at finding out what is going on, so I contacted my USDA Supervisor and the USDA PR person. The PR person sent me the information attached dated XX/XX/XXXX that outlined my medical insurance payments and what is still due. On page XXXX it states I owe a principle of {$630.00}, interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00}. After I obtained this information I mailed a {$500.00} check to the Dept. of the Treasury in XXXX XXXX with the attached XX/XX/XXXX letter. I will mail them the remaining amount when I find out if I am liable for the full amount. This brings me to one of my questions ; Am I responsible for the interest of {$2.00}, a penalty of {$6.00} and administrative costs of {$30.00} or does the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act allow for these charges to be waived because they were incurred while I was on military duty and they are trying to be collected while I am again on military duty? 
But the main reason for my contacting you, is that I visited my banks yesterday and was told that this incident is appearing on my credit report and causing damage. Again I need to ask ; does n't the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act prevent my credit from being damaged because of this? 
Please let me know if you need any more information.

During the admittance process I read all the forms provided to me by the hospital before signing them. 

Several months later I received a bill for services sent by the Emergency Room doctor.

Such information was not disclosed to me by the hospital at the time of admittance.

In light of their failure to provide the evidence of debt I have requested on multiple occasions, I ask that ProCollect stop sending letters, stop calling me by telephone and to delete this debt from any credit bureau to which they may have reported it. They have failed to do so and have continued a pattern of continuous harassment by mail and by telephone, even after I had specifically requested them, by phone and in writing, to stop doing so.

2016-08-10,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"I had a lease which began XX/XX/XXXX and ended XX/XX/XXXX. I gave the notice to vacate XX/XX/XXXX. The leasing office claimed they lost or never received the notice. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was given a 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. I informed them that I would be vacating in XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX had an eviction summons served on my door with case number XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my attorney XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX served notice upon XXXX XXXX. In the notice, Attorney XXXX confirms that in reply to Community Consultant XXXX XXXX XXXX 's email on XX/XX/XXXX inquiring whether we planned to stay or vacate, the notice to vacate was given to the leasing office with a witness present on the very same day. I additionally emailed XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX informing her that we intended to vacate. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I followed up with an additional email verifying and reiterating our intent to vacate the unit on XX/XX/XXXX and requesting to have the move out inspection scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have attached the emails with the representative from XXXX XXXX which evidence that they had written notice of our intent to vacate since XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX emailed stating that they could not locate the notice to vacate. 

I gave a notice to vacate 7 times in total through emails, written notice given in office, and XXXX notices given through my attorney serving notices upon XXXX XXXX. 

We vacated the unit on XX/XX/XXXX. The unit was professionally cleaned and photos and videos were taken of the unit since the representatives refused to acknowledge that we vacated the unit or do the move out inspection. 

I have the evidence attached verifying that the movers were paid and completed the move on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached evidence of our new lease which began at our new residence in XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Attorney XXXX XXXX served notice upon XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is attached. The notice verifies that multiple notices to vacate given, the unlawful actions of XXXX XXXX in their fraudulent billing and collection attempts, and the verification that they were paid in full. 

When I moved out, my security deposit was kept by XXXX XXXX. They processed the deposit and rather than returning the {$900.00} they owed me which was the remainder of my credit for the pro rated rent of XX/XX/XXXX, they instead sent a bill that they had added preposterous unlawful fees and charges. 

I had multiple emails with Resident Recovery collection services wherein they claimed they had added the fees and charges because we allegedly remained in the unit through XX/XX/XXXX. 

With all of the aforementioned facts which verify that we vacated on XX/XX/XXXX and gave 7 notices to vacate in the same month, it is absurd that they would try to attempt such fraudulent and deceptive billing and collection practices. The lease ended XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX with the fraudulent charges. I received multiple harassing calls from Hunter Warfield for the fraudulent debt collection. These calls were recorded. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed XXXX XXXX reiterating that they owed me {$900.00} and their billing attempts were fraudulent and unlawful. 

I spoke to the Resident Recovery department multiple times and sent them multiple emails in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They refused to acknowledge their errors and refused to delete the fraudulent billing despite receiving all of the aforementioned evidence which is attached.

XX/XX/XXXX we were XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, because of all the issues of moving furniture and weight restrictions we decided we would sell our furniture and buy when we got back to the states.. XX/XX/XXXX we were XXXX to XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Texas, The kids needed furniture so we decided to go to a local furniture store ( Home Design ). The sales person was very nice and helped us pick out the perfect set for our need at the time. The sales person informed us of a credit company they were working with had a deal where we would not have to make any payments for 24 months. The only thing was that the credit company they were going through only allowed a {$1000.00} limited so we had to get XXXX credit cards totaling XXXX. We agreed and in a week we received our furniture and everything was great. Since we were not new to getting credit, we understood that interest rates would accumulate, so I called the company about a month later to ask about my account information and mailing address so I could send my payments and not accurate interest rates. The customer service person at Synchrony Financial informed me that they were not allowed to give out my account number over the phone and that they would send me a bill soon. A month later I called again and they still refused to give me my account number and stated the same thing that a bill would arrive soon and that I could start making payments. To make a long story short I never once received a bill. As time went on I knew they would send me a bill once I started to accrue interest. Well Instead of getting a bill I got a call from the collections dept at Synchrony Financial offering a settlement. I explained to them what was going on and we came to an agreement that I would just pay it and get it over with. The last time I heard from Synchrony Financial was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX I get a letter from XXXX XXXX telling me I owed them {$970.00}. I immediately called synchrony Financial and had them send me a letter stating that I had paid off the loan and that I did not owe anything. They agreed to send me the confirmation letter. Seven days later I email XXXX with the statements and a letter of XXXX balance. XXXX does their investigation and confirms that I still owe XXXX, and I am stumped. XXXX informed me that the XXXX that I had paid to Synchrony bank was for the XXXX credit card and all the interest that was accrued. At that point I asked them to send me all the statement so I could see for myself. I expect to receive the statement XX/XX/XXXX. 
Well since we had gotten back to the States my wife and I have been working hard to get our credit scores up so we could buy a house. Two months ago my credit score was finally above the requirements for a VA Loan, so we decided to put a down on a new home. Just as we were about to settle on the mortgage this collections comes out of nowhere. We have n't gotten a rejection letter from the bank yet but they were asking about a late payment I made XX/XX/XXXX, I am pretty sure they are going to want to know how I thought I was going to get a mortgage with a collections company on my credit report. 
I have taken out some loans in the past that had some bad interest rates and but this is a whole new level of sneakiness that I just did not see coming.

XXXX XXXX would not disclose how much I owed on the account nor would he provide a settlement amount. He did however keep insisting I use a credit card to charge a settlement amount to them. He threw out percentages, but never talked numbers.

This is for a cease and desist of unlawful debt collections by XXXX XXXX, XXXX. and Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. hereafter SPS Inc. because they are violating the FDCPA, The FCRA and XXXX Georgia XXXX XXXX ; 2. On or about XXXX XXXX SPS Inc. purchased a loan account from XXXX that had been closed 4 years prior to the assignment to SPS Inc. ( See XXXX, proof of closure ). 

3. As a result of the assignment of the closed account, SPS Inc. is now fraudulently calming it has a security interest in our real property on behalf of the alleged trust previously held by Bank XXXX, Although the alleged loan was bought out of the alleged trust effective XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

4. SPS Inc. began reporting to all XXXX credit reporting agencies in XXXX XXXX under a new account number XXXX, and are now attempting non-judicial foreclosure. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Whereas, On or before XXXX, XXXX, XXXX the purported loan account held by XXXX XXXX XXXX in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, loan Number XXXX was CLOSED by XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX & XXXX proof that the account is still closed as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ). 

6. Whereas, the purported loan account has been closed for more than 4 years. Therefore, We dispute the clams made by SPS Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. for the following reasons : ( a ) They have personal knowledge that Bank XXXX Trustee for XXXX, XXXX does not have standing to foreclose on my property in the state of Georgia since they are not the secured creditor, and ( b ) They have personal knowledge that the loan obligation was bought out of the alleged trust supposedly held by Bank XXXX, as of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; and ( c ) They also have personal knowledge that the promissory note they are using as a bases for foreclosure is void after the account is charged-off or closed, and even if it was n't void it DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE OBLIGATION to which they are attempting foreclosing on. since SPS Inc. own the loan they also have personal knowledge that ASSIGNMENTS are not subject to negotiation under the XXXX. 

VIOLATIONS 7. There is an ongoing unlawful effort by SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX to intimidate, harass, and coerce us into giving them a secured interest in our property. SPS Inc. and XXXX are committing the following FDCPA violations. Whereas, ( a ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made, the representation and implication that seizure, attachment, or sale of our property in foreclosure is imminent unless a loan modification is agree too. and ( b ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made threats to take action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken. and ( c ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX Has made false representation or implication that we have committed Civil offences in order to disgrace us. and, ( d ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX are taking nonjudicial action to effect dispossession or disablement of our property, and there is no present right to possession of the property claimed as collateral through an enforceable security interest. 

( e ) The property is exempt by law from such dispossession or disablement, and ( f ) SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX, XXXX are constantly communicating with us regarding a debt by post card through third parties. 
CONCLUSION When the original loan was charged off or closed, the loan and note no longer exists ( according to UCC requirements ). All that remains is collection rights to default debt.

2016-06-10,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"For several years I have been trying to resolve a collection account with National Credit Systems. The collection account was originated by XXXX in XXXX, NC. Please see the attached copy of emails which describes the problems encountered. 
Due to the problems encountered at the XXXX with an infestation of XXXX, the Complainants were offered an early cancellation of the lease by the apartment manager onsite at the time without any fees or penalty. The Complainants accepted the offer and proceeded to move from the apartment. Apparently, later senior management decided to renege on the manager 's offer, and after the Complainant left the apartment they sent the Complainant a bill for the early cancellation of the lease. 
National Credit System, the debt collector, was allegedly contracted to collect the account. The Complainants had sent several letters to the debt collector explaining the situation, but the debt collector ignored the letters and continued to try to collect the alleged debt without verifying the Complainant 's information. The debt collector has not excised adequate due diligence to determine the validity of the account they are trying to collect despite request to so by the Complainants. The Consumer Financial Protection Board has stated in court case that the FDCPA "" grants consumers a legal right to truthful information in their dealings with debt collectors, '' the CFPB said, citing the Supreme Court 's XXXX ruling in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

The debt collector in the Complainants case is in violation of the FDCPA as indicated by the CFPB due failure to provide the Complainants with truthful information. Furthermore, the alleged debt is prescribed by the North Carolina statute of limitations which states that a contract, obligation or liability arising out of a contract, express or implied, '' is three years in accordance with N.C. Gen. Stat. XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). In addition, the debt collector is listed as an inactive debtor collector by the North Carolina Department of Insurance. As such the debt collector is trying to collect an alleged debt without a valid license as required by the State of North Carolina and in violation of N.C. Gen. Stat. XXXX which constitutes a felony. See citation below. 

The debt collector has engaged in unfair and deceptive acts, in violation of Regulation AA, by trying to collect a prescribed alleged debt and by providing a negative credit history to the credit bureaus to force the Complainants pay for debt that is not owed and a tool to collect a prescribed debt. This practice is also in violation of Fair Credit Reporting Act which prohibits creditors from providing false and inaccurate information to a credit bureau. The debtor failure to conduct adequate due diligence to determine the accuracy of the debt they are trying to collect after gaining knowledge of the disagreement with Apartment management and continuing to try to collect resulted in violation of the FCRA. The debt collector ignored the Complainants rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and purposely ignored the information provided by the Complainants with the willful intention of inflicting financial damage to the Complainants. 

The Complainants in good faith recently offered to pay an amount of up to {$200.00} for the nuisance value of the debt 's collector action, but without accepting the alleged debt, however, the debt collector did not respond to the offer. However, the offer was made before the Complainants became aware of the debt 's collectors illegal practices, unfair and deceptive acts and practices, violations of the FDCPA, and North Carolina debt collection laws and criminal violations.

I told him i was not able to do so. and he continued w harassing me. i told him a second time i wanted to speak to someone else in the office, from now on to pay my debt. he refused and hung up. I called their main office the next day, asking to speak to some one other than the current case manager, and they sent me to him anyway. I hung up. I then received a letter in the mail that was sent and written after our conversation, that stated the attempt to reach me, was unsuccessful. NOT TRUE. So i then received another phone call from this person. I asked him to verify why i owed the amount. The account manager was not making any sense as to why i would owe a certain amount of money, when i had already paid most of the amount.

The company in question, Select Portfolio Services ( SPS ) became the servicing agent for mortgage foreclosure that was filed in XXXX, and they took over servicing in XXXX. It is still being reported by them with a date of original delinquency of XXXX I contacted them to let them know that the date of original delinquency predated my dispute by over 7 years and must be deleted. Their response was essentially that it is the date of their last activity, not the date of original delinquency, that determines when the 7 year period begins to run, and that they will continue to report this delinquency until XXXX in direct violation of the FCRA. I sent them a letter demanding that they delete this entry but as of this date I have gotten no response. 
The loss of the home and other substantial assets, like a pension, a job, etc, were the direct result of the XXXX mortgage debacle. I have already suffered enough loss from that. I believe SOMEBODY has to have some relief for me instead of the banks. 
I contacted the original creditor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to verify that the date of original delinquency is over 7 years. Their verification, which I believe is incorrect and I will further investigate, said the date of original delinquency is XXXX. It is my belief that there were several missed payments before that date. Assuming that to be true, any reference to this debt must be deleted in XXXX of XXXX. SPS has refused to acknowledge this and insists that it may report until XXXX. 

I had a mortgage in place a few days ago, but because of this entry, and the false record of the date of delinquency, the mortgage was declined at the last minute and I was unable to make the purchase. Disputes have been sent to reporting agencies and the response was the same. They believe the date is extended by the date they got the account. 
Another factor is that when the started servicing the loan, it was to be under the terms and conditions agreed to by XXXX. Part of that agreement was that XXXX would take a deed in lieu of foreclosure. SPS refused to do so and cause more damages because of the time it took to finally get the property out of my name. 

My concern is not only for my account. If they are following this procedure on all of their accounts, they are undoubtedly reporting countless accounts in error. This is not a clerical mistake. It is their policy and procedure, and it a clear violation of law. They need to stop, and they need to be sanctioned for each and every violation.

After investigating our claims of this manager not repairing things in a timely manner and refusing to move our family in a new unit after a neighbors unit caught on fire and partially burn down ours, they fired her but it came after we had already moved out. The company keeps sending me a copy of my lease with the original creditor in which I have with a made up bill from that property manager with her name on the bill. There was no furniture left in the unit and nor were we evicted from the property, and all keys to the unit and mail box was turned in to management. This reporting on my credit is preventing me from obtaining a pre approval letter for a home loan and damaging my credit worthiness. The fire happened on XXXX XXXX, 2013 at night while we were away from the home. We were called to get as much out as possible and my family was placed in a hotel for a couple of days and not allowed back in for over a week.

I advised corporate after moving what happened and was told I would not owe them anything and they apologize for the actions of their employee.

I went to this lab in good faith, and furthermore, I checked with them again on their policy at that time and I was told the same information. If there was a policy change, it should have been posted at the laboratory draw center and I should have been informed at that time.

2016-05-04,Debt collection,I do not know,Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed,Debt is not mine,"Please review previous complaint, case number XXXX, and current complaint, case number : XXXX. This complaint is related to these cases. 

I submitted a complaint against XXXX debt collection agencies, XXXX and Focus Receivables Management ( Case XXXX ) as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). I received a response from XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX which is satisfactory. However, it does not look like the other debt collection agency, Focus Receivables Management, was included, so I am submitted another complaint against them. 

During an interview last month ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) with a federal agent to renew my security clearance with the federal government, I was made aware of negative entries on my Equifax credit report, specifically XXXX references to a XXXX XXXX account that is supposedly in collections. The dollar amount is similar to a previous case ( See my complaint, case # XXXX ) where a debt was mistakenly attributed to me and I was targeted by a collection agency. As you can see from the attached documentation and from the notes in the previous case, this debt was never mine and was eventually cleared ( supposedly ). In a letter dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, the Collection agency stated that XXXX XXXX notified them that the account had been cancelled and removed. 

I am not sure the XXXX collections accounts listed on my current credit report are related or not. However, I have never been contacted by XXXX XXXX at any time, and I have never been contacted by a collection agency since this issue was supposedly cleared last year. The reference to it on my credit report is my only indication of a problem. I have already disputed both accounts with XXXX. 

This debt ( s ) is not, and never has been mine. I know nothing about it other than what I see on my credit report. However, now it is directly affecting my credit rating, and worse, it may potentially affect my security clearance and therefore my prospects for future employment.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,Focus Holding Company,CA,921XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/04/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1909904
2016-05-04,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't temporarily postpone payments,"This is about XXXX and Great LakesXXXX I have been making regular payments to both for the majority of the past XXXX10 years, excluding periods where I received a temporary deferment or forbearance after school or to continue my studies. I am moving out of state to start a XXXX and care for my aging parents. I needed a forbearance for 3 months until school started as I would not have any income to make payments after I moved and prior to my new program. I contacted my lender 2 months in advance and asked what was available. Even knowing I would not have a job BUT that my income would resume ( I have documentation attesting that I have a salaried position beginning when I start my XXXX in the XX/XX/2016 ), they informed me that I would have to pay or have my credit downgraded. I asked about partial payments, interest only payments, and any other programs. They pleasantly informed me that there was nothing they could do. I have worked XXXX for ten years, getting paid much less than my counterparts doing work that is intended to assist those who can not help themselves. Even still, my credit is near perfect ; I have not missed or been late on payments ; and if I have an issue I have always contacted them to adjust payment due dates, etc. I have been a good customer and want to pay what I owe. The fact that I can verify my future income and have an excellent payment and credit history has not made a difference. 

Additionally, a couple of years ago I joined the military and was XXXX XXXX for XXXX months. Prior to and during that time, I tried to work with the lender to have my payments reduced, postponed or suspended while I was away. Eleven months later I received notices from my lenders that I was approved. I had continued paying up until that time because I did not want problems with the lenders or my credit because I had not heard from them. So my SCRA benefits were effectively unavailable to me. Now when I asked to use the time I was approved for that I did not get to use because of their unexplained delays, I am told that it is too late and I should have used it then. How is that possible? I can not use what you do not make available to me. I am not going to incur irreparable harm because of their failures. This is unacceptable. Even when I am entitled to assistance, they refuse to assist me! 

Something must be done. I do n't deserve to have my credit ruined because I want to support my parents and have achieved a milestone ( gained admittance to a Ph.D. Program all expenses paid with a salary ). While my situation is nowhere near as dire as that of others, I do not want to fail to follow through on my commitments. The crazy thing is, if this was a mortgage or credit card there would be options available to me. These same companies offer those services and options to me as a customer with a different product, but as a student somehow my needs and responsibilities are different. If I was of a different mind, I would let it go and never bother to pay them, knowing I have a job and a house and a car and can get around having negative credit. These backward and aggressive financial practices does not do the economy or our current and future workforces any good. We never should have bailed out these companies, especially since, when we need bail outs, ones that we can guarantee we can pay back, they are unwilling to help. As a taxpayer, consumer, and productive citizen I should get at the very least what these businesses get. There is no justice, no equality, no protection for me. Instead, my good service is ignored, my timely payment history is of no consequence, but my tax dollars are necessary to support institutions that do not support me. I request action. These businesses should not be allowed to operate if their practices are harmfully aggressive towards consumers.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,GREAT LAKES,MD,207XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/06/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1909771

I transferred mobile carriers from XXXX to XXXX on the last day of my billing cycle. I shortly thereafter called to confirm my balance was XXXX dollars. 

My account was later debited about {$400.00}, and so I called for a refund, but was informed that I was no longer the account owner and needed permission from one of the remaining lines, my mom. The representative three-way called my mom, who asked XXXX to refund me. I received a refund a few days later. 

About two months later I received a bill for over {$1000.00}, but when I called to dispute the bill, I was told I was the account owner, and moreover that I did not transfer liability pursuant to an "" assumption of liability '' policy outlined on XXXX website, which I disputed as inapplicable, and because it contradicted prior representations. XXXX then changed the page in an apparent move to defeat my complaint. 

My mom states that XXXX told her she could not leave the carrier until the following billing cycle and that she would not be charged. From the billing statement I received, there was no usage on her line, but she was still charged. 

The debt was sent to a collection agency, but after I wrote them a letter, they apologized and said they would cease their collection efforts, and would forward our correspondence to XXXX.

Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"TRANSUNION INTERMEDIATE HOLDINGS, INC.",NC,280XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,04/28/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1898441

Regarding the BAD MANAGEMENT of these apartments, at an apartment complex build and managed by the same company that is building and managing XXXX It appears as though management lied about the amenities that they offered such being a tanning bed and garages. It appears as though management and or other personnel of the apartments did willfully and intentionally alter our lease contract by extending the end date of the contract by one month without our knowledge and approval. It appears as though management and or other personnel photographed themselves as they vandalized the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated at the apartments. After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments photographed themselves as they intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. The management and or other personnel then blamed me for ripping the carpet seams apart and billed me for the replacement of the entire said carpet in the apartment and violating the end date of said lease. 
The same may happen to you. 
During construction you will eat dirt and your car will be covered with dirt. You will constantly head the sound of builders and machinery, and the amenities they promised you will either never be there of be built a year or more later. 
They are petty and rude and have a relationship with a collection agency that will submit your name and social security number to XXXX and other credit bureaus on management 's request.

Fraud is the intentional use of deceit, a trick or some dishonest means to deprive another of his or her or its money, property or a legal right. A party who has lost something due to fraud is entitled to file a lawsuit for damages against the party acting fraudulently, and the damages may include punitive damages as a punishment or public example due to the malicious nature of the fraud. Quite often there are several persons involved in a scheme to commit fraud and each and all may be liable for the total damages. Inherent in fraud is an unjust advantage over another which injures that person or entity. It includes failing to point out a known mistake in a contract. There is a known mistake in a contract that was never pointed out to me by my broker. It also includes failing to not reveal a fact which he or she has a duty to communicate, such as not delivering promised amenities. My broker promised amenities including a tanning bed and garages as originally understood. The amenities of a tanning bed and garages were not delivered to me as promised. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty such as lying about advertising amenities that were not delivered. Constructive fraud can be proved by a showing of breach of legal duty without direct proof of fraud or fraudulent intent. Extrinsic fraud occurs when deceit is employed to keep someone from exercising a right, such as a fair trial, by hiding evidence or misleading the opposing party in a lawsuit.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Resolve Partners, LLC",NC,280XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,05/19/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1884578

( CA herein ). First major delinquency was XX/XX/XXXX due to loss of employment & the balance due according to XXXX credit bureaus is {$3600.00}, but balance due as reported by CA {$3500.00}. The XXXX value of the repo 'd SUV for dealer trade in TODAY is {$1200.00} & SUV was repo 'd in XX/XX/XXXX. I did n't receive notice of the sale of the vehicle, but was furnished a copy of what CA claimed to have sent me regarding resale. No deficiency balance ever noted!!! A couple years went by with no correspondence from CA until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when the sheriff delivered me a final judgment, entered by default as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Upon receiving this, I called XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX herein ) who identified themselves as debt collectors for CA saying the balance due as of judgment is now {$6900.00} & to call for payment arrangements. I was confused and skeptical, as I had already paid roughly {$20000.00} on the contract & there was no record of a deficiency balance applied. 
After researching more on my own, as circumstantially I could not afford legal advisory, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I sent a request via certified mail usps to XXXX for a complete debt validation to include all info in my file, the original contract & a full accounting of all transactions. In response to my request on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I only received a general response & a copy of the final judgment, no debt validation & no account of the proceeds, deficiency balance or how the sale was processed & there are NO DOCUMENTED PROCEEDS from the deficiency balance towards what is owed, EVER. I was hesitant to make pymnt arrangements in fear of validating the debt, but when I called the courthouse to verify the judgment, it was on file as a legally binding document. As of XX/XX/XXXX, CA has reported the account status with all XXXX credit bureaus with the delinquencies and repossession noted, but never once was a judgment or public notice recorded & said account has been closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, to be scheduled for removal by XX/XX/XXXX. All XXXX credit bureaus reported the same data. Something was n't right & I had read hundreds of complaints via internet regarding unfair & illegal practices by CA. 
On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I hesitantly made the first payment of 9 for the {$75.00} arrangement agreement to XXXX from my XXXX checking and have the records. The most recent payment cleared XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

No other forms of correspondence attempted. Last Thursday, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I went to use my debit card and it was declined even though I had over {$1700.00} in my account & had just deposited my payroll. XXXX bank informed me that my account was levied by CA & without any prior notice from my bank or CA. The telephone # I was given sends me to a TN county clerk & that is all the contact info provided. I still have yet to receive any notice from my bank or XXXX or CA regarding the levy & questioning if all this is legal practice. I 've heard of CA judgments being vacated after entered due to CA filing fraudulent affidavits with the courts. When I calculate the amount due under the terms by CA in the judgment, I get completely different amounts and I think they are suing for interest on attorney fees, other interest charges and there are credits of {$0.00} for deficiency and resale of SUV? I definitely can not afford a lawyer now & thinking this is a fraudulent attempt to collect before the SOL is up because the judgment is fraud.

"" Dear Government : Thank you for your kind email. 
I would have gladly paid back this loan earlier was it not for the following facts : 1 ) : The course taught or was supposed to teach me XXXX. When I completed the course a year later XXXX was being taught & being used which meant that my studies in XXXX was a waste of time, money & effort. Furthermore it meant that I would have to spend yet another year learning XXXX, & who is going to pay for that??? 
2 ) : When I graduated from university in XXXX I learned very quickly that it mattered not so much what I studied but where I studied it. I live near XXXX ( XXXX ) major hospitals : 1 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 2 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital XXXX XXXX ; 3 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 4 ) : XXXX XXXX Hospital ; 5 ) : XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital. Not one of the aforementioned hospitals have ever heard of the XXXX XXXX, the institution that talked me into taking the course!!! 
3 ) : Since I am currently XXXX with XXXX XXXX I have to see an endless stream of doctors. As a matter of fact they are about the ONLY people I see these days!!! I have noticed that when they draft a script or notes, the computer automatically assigns XXXX & XXXX codes which means that someone is n't sitting in the backroom assigning codes from reference books. 
4 ) : I always thought that a placement service served to place their candidates in jobs. I discovered that The XXXX XXXX did not & does not provide such a service. Their idea of such a service was to simply list them as a reference. 
5 ) : Upon graduation I learned that voice recognition was being used in coding meaning that the system would assign codes in accordance with vocal statements of diagnoses. 
6 ) : I registered for the course in the expectation of finding suitable employment upon course completion. The XXXX XXXX told me that there was a great demand for coders & that finding suitable employment would not be a problem for me. I later discovered that every job listing answered REQUIRED a 2-3 experience. How am I going to get the experience when no one is going to hire me because I do not have the required experience??? 
7 ) : I completed the course in XXXX. It is now XXXX. Five years later! I have not profited in any manner whatsoever from my studies nor do I expect to as I have forgotten everything that I studied given the passage of time. 
I wrote to the U S Justice Department about this matter as I strongly feel that I was sold a bad bill of goods meaning fraud which, unless I am mistaken, is a felony, but they could not be bothered. Instead they sent me information on where to find a place to live, information that in no way whatsoever addressed my problem. Currently I am living on XXXX & XXXX. 
You would be correct in assuming that I have a chip on my shoulder, but who would n't given what I have described above? Having had to declare Chapter XXXX bankruptcy last XXXX that was partially fueled by not finding a job in XXXX XXXX & XXXX my credit is already destroyed. I dont think that you can destroy my credit more than it has already been. 
The other part of the Chapter XXXX was caused by debts incurred from XXXX XXXX when my late wife was diagnosed & operated for what later became on Friday, XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX hours XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was unable to work during that time as I did what I thought every husband was supposed to do by remaining home to care for her given that she required XXXX three weeks of every month. A death certificate will be submitted upon request as proof. 
I am sorry if I am rambling & sound like a XXXX boar, but I just wanted to give you the entire picture of the reason.

2016-03-15,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Back in XXXX I communicated with a collection agency named Continental Central Credit. I spoke to them because they had a collection account in their office which they were reporting on my credit report. When I spoke with this collection agency, I spoke with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX was the collector who was in charge of this particular account. When I spoke with him, I explained my situation to him and we had agreed upon me paying an amount of {$700.00} as well as having the account removed from my credit report due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the nature of the debt. We agreed that I would post date a payment on the XXXX of XXXX because that is when I got paid for the month. I only get paid once a month. 

I thought the situation was taken care of until I received another notice saying that they will sue me if I do n't pay the amount of the post dated payment as well as a {$25.00} Non sufficient fund fee. At this point I had my representative step in and try to figure out what was going on because I know I had funds in my bank account. In fact, because of this entire ordeal, I was forced to go to my bank and provide them documentation about the non sufficient funds to figure out what was happening and I also printed out a statement which shows I had money in the bank at that time. 

After further review, my representative then noticed that the date the collection agency attempted to withdraw funds was listed the XXXX of XXXX and not the XXXX of XXXX as XXXX XXXX XXXX and I had agreed upon. My representative then spoke to the collection agency to ask why they were attempting to charge me non sufficient fund fees as well as threaten to sue me if they had attempted to withdraw funds on a date that was not agreed upon. The response that he received was truly exasperating. 

The collector XXXX stated that we had n't agreed upon the XXXX but the XXXX. He claimed that to have it in by the XXXX it had to be withdrawn then. That statement was a complete falsehood. Besides the obvious fact that the XXXX was days after XXXX therefore chances are I did n't have money to spend, but it 's also days before I get paid and therefore I would never agree to such a deal. Furthermore, when my representative attempted to play nice and chalk it up to a whole misunderstanding and to offer them the same amount as before which was the {$700.00}, the collector said he could n't do it because the funds had to be withdrawn before the XXXX of XXXX. He also made a statement that the settlement offer was no longer valid. At this point my representative asked for the Supervisor. 

The supervisor was named XXXX XXXX. he tried to explain to her the entire situation. He informed her that the funds withdrawal was according to their own documentation attempted on the wrong dates. He also informed her that I was willing to still pay the agreed upon amount. She would n't hear any of it. Although her tone was very cordial, she simply reiterated what the collector tried to tell me and instead of noticing that they had wronged me and were attempting to wrong me more, she tried to focus on why I was able to afford the full amount and therefore did not require a settlement. At this point they are being malicious and they have broken the law. 

They essentially pulled a bait and switch on me. They lied to me in order to collect more money than agreed upon, attempted to withdraw money when they were n't supposed to, and now they are attempting to extort illegal non sufficient fees and treble damages. 

At this point I am very upset and if they attempt to sue me for these ridiculous charges, I will counter sue. I ca n't believe a collection agency is allowed to operate like this. Please look into them as they should not be extorting people for money. Their job is to collect and not to try and con people out of thheir money",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,"Continental Central Credit, Inc.",CA,933XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/15/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1832836

SPS, insists that the sale will occur on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX regardless of my claims. 
Their are many issues associated with the standing issue. None of the actions taken against me would have been by the correct party, the Notice of Default, the recording of assignments would all be invalid. 
Legal documents that were used against me relating to bank standing were altered. The copies of notes used to prove bank standing had undated indorsements in blank. In XX/XX/XXXX in response to a QWR, XXXX sent copies of these notes stamped "" Certified Copy of Original Document '' which have no indorsements. 
There are also several serious servicing issues with XXXX and then SPS who was substituted in as servicer for XXXX. When the servicing was moved from XXXX I was in underwriting, at the very end of a modification for both properties. SPS refused to continue the modification that was in underwriting at XXXX. 
SPS has violated many servicing regulations, including Single Point of Contact, Dual Tracking, and the requirement to offer foreclosure alternative solutions in good faith. They send letters saying that those opportunities are available, but SPS has blocked every attempt I have made for a foreclosure alternative. Since they stopped the modification I had in underwriting at XXXX, I have not had the opportunity to utilize any foreclosure alternative. Many servicers are intentionally deceiving and misleading both the borrower and the regulatory agencies, pretending to follow servicing guidelines and requirements, when they are actually trying to sell the property. SPS said they had opened a short sale and I would have four months to list the property and find a buyer. They kept putting me off when I called and then said they could n't open the program because I did n't have a listing. I got a listing which was emailed to them. They emailed confirmation of receipt and said they would respond in writing. They did n't. Then they told me that they had closed out the short sale program because I did n't have "" an offer in hand! '' This entire time, they refused to send me any confirmation in writing that I was actually in the short sale program and continued efforts to sell the property at trustee sale. When I told them they were dual tracking, they said that technically they were n't because "" they had never actually approved the program. '' This is commonly done. I know that I am one of many borrowers who have met with these same experiences. 
Please look into this situation and, if possible, pressure SPS to stop the sale until all issues have been addressed.

The transaction by definition was a refinance of the original table funded adjustable rate loan which is classified as predicator per XXXX by Reg Z, to wit ( unenforceable ).

2. A foreclosure can not legally take place if the deed and note is for a different loan type than the lender/creditor is trying to collect on.

A new 30 year conventional note, security deed, and new disclosures documents should have been executed. However, that never occurred. The current deed and note on record, although void by operation of law under TILA and Reg.

In the foreclosure documents SPS Inc. and XXXX XXXX XXXX is says they are operating on behalf of XXXX f/k/a the XXXX, as Trustee for the Certificateholders of CWABS XXXX it is a false statement. For the loan to be held in trust, a re-securitization had to occur, with a new XXXX XXXX number per SEC.

She informed me they were not required to send a bill. I informed her I had received a bill for 10 months in a row, that pretty much sets a precedence that they send a bill. That 's when she informed me I was going to have to pay court costs and she added it to my original debt. These people never gave me any opportunity to answer this debt at all, much less the first thing I hear from them is by a summons. The Dr. and the hospital who were involved in this same procedure are very close to being paid in full. This debt would be paid right down with them if they had continued to send us a bill. I checked with XXXX and with Optima Recovery and they both assured me they do send bills regardless what XXXX XXXX contends from The attorneys office. I have a severly XXXX that we have been working and waiting on the VA for 2 yrs. now to get the operations I need. It 's been longer than that since I could work. My wife lost her good paying job in XX/XX/XXXX and she has had to work with a temp service just to be able to have some kind of employment. Yet we paid each and every bill so it upsets me greatly when someone tries to cheat us like this and add some supposed court costs to our debt, when we have not gone to court. Not quite sure why they quit sending us a bill but if they had we would have continued paying it. When anything medical quits coming in you figure the insurance finally paid.

This matter has gone on for so long without results, despite repeated attempts to deal with XXXX, that more effective action is required. 

The history is as follows : 1. We terminated service on XXXX account number XXXX XXXX XXXX for telephone and internet service in XXXX XXXX CA on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. An automatic bank payment arrangement was cancelled on XXXX XXXX. Both cancellations were confirmed in a telephone call with a XXXX XXXX of XXXX on XXXX XXXX. We opened a new XXXX ( telephone and internet ) service on XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX CA.

Another telephone conversation with "" XXXX '' : "" do n't pay, a corrected bill will be sent. '' 4. In a new bill, dated XXXX XXXX I was again told I owed {$100.00} for the terminated service. Another telcon with a XXXX XXXX of XXXX on XXXX XXXX : "" All charges are removed, your balance is XXXX, a final bill will be sent by mail. '' 5. A letter dated XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX Credit and Collections ( re account XXXX XXXX XXXX, as above ) states : "" We recently sent you ... Failure to pay the outstanding balance on your bill by XXXX XXXX XXXX may cause your account to be referred to an outside collection agency. This could result in reporting your debt to the credit bureaus which may affect your credit standing. "" Please pay, etc. 

6. A letter, dated XXXX XXXX XXXX, from debt collector XXXX XXXX, XXXX informing me that the bill for {$100.00} had been referred to this collection agency. Please pay, etc. 

7. A XXXX on XXXX XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX Customer Service : "" The balance is XXXX ; ... with the next bill - XXXX - this will show.

XXXX ( sic ; note the difference from the no. in item 1. ) It is not credible that XXXX Credit and Collections Office is simply not aware of these cases, there must be many of them. It appears to be a practice of theirs to ignore the customer service inputs, and keep pursuing these settled cases in the expectation that they will eventually just give up and pay anyway, to avoid the nuisance and the repeated threats, and particularly to avoid a credit record problem. There seems to be no deterrent to them for such practice. 

These repeated attempts to bring threats by debt collection agencies, long after the original issue has been resolved, in fact amounts to a form of harassment and intimidation, and may even amount legally to a form of extortion. It needs to be dealt more effectively than simply by more letters or emails. The CPFB needs to get involved.

She asked for my current address to do this ; I gave it to her and got off the phone. 

I checked my credit report where I found no record of the US Bank account. I checked a report generated a year ago and saw the account. The account is not mine ; I have zero recollection of opening or paying on this account. I attempted to open a dispute, and was unable to because the account had come off my report the year prior. I called the company back.

Please find attached a copy of the lease that appears to have been altered by management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

Please note that the collection agency or the creditor will probably refuse to show you the actual lease because the creditor altered the lease and have therefore incriminated themselves. 

Please note that the creditor has already sent a dossier regarding this case to the NC Department of Justice, and the NC Department of Justice has sent a copy of that dossier to me. 

If you look at the lease then you will see that the creditor simply changed the end date of the lease from XXXX/XXXX/2014 to XXXX/XXXX/2014 without my knowledge and approval. 

Please find attached pictures of what appears to be management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. 

After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel employed by the apartments allegedly took the photographs. 

The pictures appear to show management and or other apartment personnel in the process of I think willfully and intentionally vandalizing the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated from the apartments. 

Upon my denial of said accusations, management and or other personnel at the apartments ordered a collection agency, Resolve Partners, to collect payment from me for damaging said carpet and violating said lease. 

When I refused to pay the collector for damages by management and or other personnel at the apartments to said carpet and what I think was contract malpractice by management and or other personnel at the apartments, the collector referred me to XXXX, thereby damaging my credit rating. 

The collector accepted this account from the apartments with I think possibly no proof of wrong doing by me. 

The collector accepted this account from the apartments and referred this account to XXXX with no substantiated proof of wrong doing by me.

2016-01-28,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"Perhaps this is a common problem. I have had private law school loans since 1998. These loans are currently split between XXXX service providers - XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) and Access Group ( ACS ). Since my loans went into repayment, I never missed a payment, and paid my full amount owed every month. However, in the last couple of years, I 've had some challenges. I had to take time off from full-time employment due to some health issues, and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers, I was able to suspend the federal loans, but the private ones have been more problematic. I am told I have no other options with those at this point. The monthly for ACS is {$270.00} and the monthly for XXXX is {$230.00}. The financial stress on our family is significant because of this, as I am not bringing in an income and not receiving any type of unemployment assistance. The lenders claim I have no options. I asked if it might be possible for me to pay a lower amount each month until I obtain employment. The answer was no, that this would still be considered default, even if I paid XXXX-XXXX percent of the amount owed each month. Essentially paying a substantial portion counts for nothing. I feel that this makes no sense and is borderline predatory. It seems as if trying to work out an arrangement with them is impossible. I understand why people give up and do n't pay at all. However, I have excellent credit and it 's important to me to retain this. It 's going to wipe out our savings over the next few months. I think the unwillingness to work with clients during financial difficulties is a real problem. This is not credit card debt. Most of us with these loans are responsible consumers. The failure to work with an individual who is willing to pay the maximum possible in his/her current financial situation, is something that I felt was worth documenting.

I agreed to pay this until I could investigate the allegations and so that the collection agency would not contact the credit bureau and damage my credit. I knew that the alleged amount owed was drastically wrong because my earnings from my work for the entire year was only around {$75000.00}. 

I hired a C.P.A. and together we did my XX/XX/XXXX state tax forms again : I owed {$260.00}! Also, XX/XX/XXXX I had called the N.M. State Taxation department and was frequently in contact with an employee there who was handling my account. I sent the N.M. State Personal Income Tax forms directly to her as she instructed, by certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX. Meanwhile, I had been paying {$100.00} per month to Performant Recovery. When I informed the N.M. State Dept. of Taxation of their huge error I demanded that they notify Performant Recovery to discontinue billing my credit card immediately and reimburse me the overpayments that I made. Also, I called the Performant Recover company several times and was left "" holding '' for 20-30 minutes every time without ever speaking to a human being. I then left messages about stopping the monthly charges. However, they never stopped charging my bank credit card even at this writing! Phone calls to the N.M. State Taxation and Revenue Dept. were never returned and the woman who had handled my account was sent to a different department. The new person never returned my calls or contacted me in any way. My bank fined me late charges for not paying the {$100.00} bill per month and I filed complaints with the bank ; but Performant Recovery kept charging my credit card and still is. They are sending threatening letters to me about what they are calling a "" delinquent account '' for a balance of {$2600.00} when I owed the state of N.M. only {$260.00}.!

The XXXX XXXX apartments are located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, NC XXXX, phone : XXXX. 

Based on my analysis of this situation, I hereby submit this complaint against XXXX XXXX, manager of the XXXX XXXX apartments, and XXXX in the State of North Carolina. 

Here are my thoughts. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel of the apartments did willfully and intentionally alter our lease at the apartments without our knowledge and approval. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel vandalize the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated at the apartments. 

After vacating said apartment, we hired an apartment cleaning service to clean said apartment, and we hired a carpet cleaning service to clean said carpet. 

After management and maintenance personnel from the apartments examined and approved the condition and cleanliness of said apartment, it appears as though management and or other personnel at the apartments intentionally forced a finger between the seams of the carpet and ripped the seams apart. 

The management and or other personnel then blamed me for ripping the carpet seams apart and billed me for the replacement of said carpet and violating the end date of said lease. 

Please find attached a copy of the page of the lease that management and or other personnel at the apartments appear to have willfully and intentionally altered without our knowledge and approval. 

Please find attached pictures of what appears to be management and or other personnel at the apartments. 

It appears as though management and or other personnel employed by the apartments allegedly took the photographs. 

The pictures appear to show management and or other apartment personnel in the process of I think willfully and intentionally vandalizing the carpet in the apartment that we rented and vacated from the apartments. 

Upon my denial of said accusations, management and or other personnel at the apartments ordered a collection agency, Resolve Partners, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NC XXXX, phone : XXXX to collect payment from me for damaging said carpet and violating said lease. 

Based on my analysis of this situation, I hereby submit this complaint against Resolve Partners. 

Here are my thoughts. 

When I refused to pay the collector for damages by management and or other personnel at the apartments to said carpet and what I think was contract malpractice by management and or other personnel at the apartments, the collector referred me to XXXX XXXX, thereby damaging my credit rating. 

The collector accepted this account from the apartments with I think possibly no proof of wrong doing by me. 

The collector accepted this account from the apartments and referred this account to XXXX XXXX with no substantiated proof of wrong doing by me.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"Resolve Partners, LLC",NC,280XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,01/21/2016,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1747189

The dealer then set up the paperwork for a ford van, trading my car in as collateral. 

After driving the van we discovered that it was previously damaged from an accident. 

This is where things get weird. 

Before we returned the van [ about 3 days ] they sold my car. I was then forced to buy a more expensive car, a XXXX XXXX. 

Shortly after taking possession of the vehicle, XXXX XXXX XXXX began not posting our payments, then became threatening. 

As I am a XXXX veteran and a negotiable person, I agreed to return the car back to the dealership completely undamaged [ which we did ] and left the keys inside the dealership. 

In XXXX XXXX we left the US for 24 months. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote off the contract as I returned the vehicle undamaged. 

Then- out of nowhere comes a case filed in court against us for the entire cost of the vehicle by some party not affiliated with XXXX XXXX . 
We responded to the subpoena in writing mailed certified return receipt to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

The certified mailed return receipt response was properly addressed and mailed within the required time to respond.

In other words, a debt not real, or valid. 

The debt was sold to a collections firm in XXXX Colorado [ Machol & Johannes ] that is not affiliated with BBB, and suspect for illegal collection practices. 

They have upped the amount to nearly XXXX for debt I simply do not owe due to the judge refusing to open my mailed certified return receipt response and to review the fact that I had returned the car to the dealership undamaged as agreed with XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Someone has repeatedly vandalized our only vehicle-a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, rendering it inoperable. We believe that this may be the work of the collection firm. So I am out of any vehicle now. Its XXXX.

Neither PDQ, XXXX or the credit reporting agencies wanted to listen to my plea. I honestly feel that I have been taken advantage of and become a victim of shoddy medical collection practices. I also think that the doctor never attempted to contact me as this could have easily been paid in the early stages if only I had been contacted. I asked the credit reporting agencies to verify the methods and they basically gave me a nonchalant answer. They claimed to have verified the collection but could n't have as PDQ and the doctor sent me a letter stating that they were not going to address my complaint. Everyone ignored my pleas after I paid the account and all they wanted was their money. They had no concern for my rights as a citizen. The credit reporting agency says that they mask reports when sending out medical information but I am inclined to disagree as I see poor reporting from them each time I look at my credit reports now. PDQ does not bargain in good faith and should have never had my medical information in the first place as they have no business associate agreement with the doctor.

I got an auto loan XX/XX/XXXX and it was paid off XX/XX/XXXX ( to make room on our debt ratio for a new home ). Up until that point, the loan was reported as paid as agreed with no lates.

After further investigation, I find out that the check was delivered to them on XX/XX/XXXX via XXXX and delivered to the front desk.

This XXXX late payment caused my credit scores to drop XXXX points on XXXX bureau - XXXX points on another and I 'm still waiting on the last bureau to get this negative information.

2015-11-30,Debt collection,Medical,Communication tactics,Threatened to take legal action,"In XXXX 2015 I received a collections notice from "" Bay Area Credit Service '' - I had no idea what it was for so I sent a FAX requesting more information, such as to whom the money was owed and for what ... .. I then set it aside to await a response and if none received intended to turn it over to the police as mail "" phishing scam ''. 
On XXXX/XXXX/15, I had still received no response so I decided to attempt calling them before reporting it to the police. It turns out that the debt was a valid medical debt however, the provider failed to send me a bill and in speaking with the original service provider ( XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, CA ), it turns out they had the secondary insurance information all along and simply failed to bill them either. Additionally, they advised that they had a different address but this has been the address for years and was also the address where the service was provided. The first person I spoke with said they attempted phone contact but they did not and when I mentioned that to the supervisor, she did not indicate that any attempt to contact by telephone was made. The hospital and physicians who provided treatment related to this injury all have the correct information and were all paid in full within weeks of service. 
My concern is that this type of business practice damages a person 's credit - especially when the 'debtor ' would have been and still is more than willing and able to pay any uncovered expenses. 
After two hours of phone calls and speaking with a supervisor, I was told they would forward the information to the collection agency and request that it not be reported to credit agencies. I explained that I was comfortable sharing any more information with any collection agency and again requested that they pull it out of collections, bill the secondary insurance and then, if any monies were owed, bill me for the remainder. 
The supervisor at XXXX XXXX XXXX was unfamiliar with the procedure to pull back any accounts sold to collections but will look into it and phone me back in two days. Even if I am successful in pressuring them to do the right thing, it is clear that correcting mistakes is not a standard policy or practice for this provider. 
Is there a law in place protecting people from such damaging business practices? if not, there should be. I did read that the collections agency is required to give you the original provider 's information such as the name and contact information and that was not done upon receipt of my FAXED inquiry in XXXX 2015 and when I spoke with them today, they gave me the name but refused to give me the contact information for the provider ( I found it myself online ). 
Additionally, the practice of 'selling ' accounts due at a reduced rate when they are in fact able to collect through standard billing methods, only serves to further increase the already inflated cost of medical care - making it increasingly difficult for average citizens to obtain and pay for needed medical care.",Company can't verify or dispute the facts in the complaint,"HOVG, LLC",CA,960XX,"Older American, Servicemember",Consent provided,Web,11/30/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1676389

2015-11-26,Debt collection,"Other (i.e. phone, health club, etc.)",False statements or representation,Attempted to collect wrong amount,"Filed against : National Credit Systems , Inc . 
XXXX XXXX XXXX GA XXXXComplaint Description : The National Credit Systems , Inc. states that I owe on account # XXXX a total of {$3600.00}. The account in question is from an apartment that had an agreement terminated XX/XX/XXXX. I discovered this debt by checking my credit report and inquiring about it. On my credit it shows as debt owed beginning XX/XX/XXXX, however it should be changed to the correct date of XX/XX/XXXX. No attempt has ever been made to reach me regarding this debt that began XX/XX/XXXX. I had cosigned for an apartment for a friend of mine and was never notified of the failure to pay a debt. The person who rented the apartment, informed the apartment management that she was unable to afford the apartment and that she would be terminating the agreement early. She was told that if she left within three days that she would only be charged the early termination fee of {$2400.00} and no other fees. She left within three days per their agreement and made an arrangement to pay {$100.00} per month until the debt was paid off. In addition to the deposit on the apartment that paid off {$220.00} toward the termination fee, she made one payment of {$100.00} XX/XX/XXXX and did not make payments afterward. Once I found out about my credit score I called National Credit Systems to resolve issue. They state that instead of the {$2400.00} ( minus the {$100.00} payment and the {$220.00} deposit ), we also owe {$1200.00} for less than 60 day notice, pro-rated rent at {$32.00}, {$180.00} for cleaning charges, {$3.00} in damages, and {$19.00} in water/sewage which brings us to a total of {$3900.00} ( minus the {$220.00} deposit ). We should not have to pay the {$1200.00} for not giving 60 days notice as the arrangement with management was to leave within 3 days to avoid these charges, and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints, I have contacted this company and was met with extreme hostility. They yell over me when I merely ask questions regarding this debt which is news to me. They hang up on me frequently. They are rude, condescending, and insulting. At this point, when I call them they simply put me on hold until they eventually hang up on me. The company agreed to consider the debt settled at XXXX % ( {$2500.00} ), and yet when I asked for that agreement to be made in writing prior to payment, they refused saying that I must take their oral agreement and nothing else. I do not trust them to keep their agreement without seeing something in writing. To reiterate, I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the three credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously. I would also like the agreement they made with me at considering this debt settled at XXXX % to be put in writing prior to payment. 

Desired Resolution : I would like National Credit Systems , Inc. to provide to the XXXX credit reporting agencies the actual beginning date of this debt XX/XX/XXXX and not XX/XX/XXXX that they reported previously.

2015-11-03,Debt collection,Non-federal student loan,Disclosure verification of debt,Right to dispute notice not received,"As per my correspondence received XX/XX/XXXX concerning my dispute with the University of XXXX . ( SEE ATTACHED DOC ) How can an invalidated debt become a charge-off? 

I am in dispute of this charge-off. A charge-off is a notation on your credit report indicating that the original lender has written off the charge as unlikely to ever be paid. An account that is 120 to 180 days past due usually will be charged off. In this situation, I find it particularly troubling that XXXX would charge-off a debt at such a stage. ESPECIALLY WITH A {$00.00} BALANCE. ( SEE ACCOUNT HISTORY. 
A charge-off is an internal bookkeeping measure taken by a creditor that requires a concurrent finding by them that they now considers the debt to be "" uncollectible. '' In this case, It is pretty far stretch for them to conclude that this debt was uncollectible when it has not even reached the stage of being reportable to a CRA as a 30-day late, and I never received notification that I owed this debt. 
Charge-offs are required by statute for many creditors when a debt has reached a certain level of delinquency, usually 180 days. The reason for compelling charge-offs is to prevent corporations from overstating their assets, of which unpaid debts are a receivable asset, in their financial reportings, and thus misleading stockholders and others of the financial stability of a corporation. 

Accordingly, I can show any judge that this accounts is inaccurate and that XXXX has violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act by ignoring my requests to investigate the items. My previous letters -- stated my reasons for an investigation and these reasons were not frivolous in any way. As reported, I XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX never received any disbursements ' from the XXXX See Invoice Statement. Generated, by attached emails from My University XXXX XXXX Payment History Financial Aide Account. - I did not receive these funds. Neither were they deposited into my checking account. Please provide a copy of this document, ( Check ) for this transaction that was endorsed by me, that XXXX claims was issued to me in the amount of {$810.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to substantiate this transaction. 
On the other hand, an institution of higher education that reports information regarding a student loan to the CRAs, must report it in a manner consistent with the rules of the FCRA and it must also respond to a request for investigation in compliance with the statute, the FCRA should still protect consumers from inaccurate reporting. Debtors deserve the right to dispute a debt and request an investigation of inaccurate reporting. Allowing colleges and universities to avoid their responsibility as a furnisher would contradict the purpose of this consumer minded statute. 
If this final request does not prompt you to conduct a proper investigation of the accounts in question, and send proof to me of said investigation, I will file a civil suit. for damages. I take my credit very seriously and XXXX 's lack of professionalism and assistance is unacceptable. I am well aware of my rights under the FCRA and intend to pursue them to the maximum.

To finance my education, I paid with a mix of federal and private loans, as well as my personal finances. My private loans were issued through Wells Fargo Bank ( although I had come to Wells Fargo through XXXX ). After applying for my loans, I never received any correspondence from Wells Fargo. I was given no account information to view my loans online, and even when I tried to track this information down online by entering other personal information, like Social Security number, birthdate, first and last name, their online system could not link me to any account ( which I find odd considering almost every other banking institution can retrieve your account information from your personal information filled out in your account applications ). 

Having never taken out student loans previously, I was not completely understanding of how the process worked. Since my loans were then issued and distributed through XXXX University 's financial aid office, I did n't suspect any issues or negligence on the part of the bank. 

My loans will soon fall out of their grace period next month, and after having still not been contacted by Wells Fargo, I called to find out any information. In speaking with several loan service officers, I learned I DO in fact have an account number, which had never been given to me through any correspondence. I learned my mailing address had been incorrectly recorded in their system, and so I had never received any snail-mail correspondence that would have provided information to access my online account. 

I was never emailed nor mailed ANY statements notifying me of quarterly interest payments, which I could have been making ( and DID make on my federal loans ) during school. 

I have now accrued nearly {$10000.00} in interest that I was never notified of, and the bank accepts culpability for mailing loan disclosure agreements to the wrong address and for also failing to EVER correspond with me through email so that I could access my online account. 

I understand from the XXXX XXXX XXXX 's XX/XX/XXXX article ( XXXX ) that Wells Fargo has been under investigation by the CFPB, so I am submitting my case to help further this investigation.

Defendant received a summons addressed to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX to appear in this Court on XXXX XXXX, 2014. Defendant answers the summons on XXXX XXXX, 2014 that stated he resides in the State of XXXX, and would be unable to attend the hearing, due to employment obligations. 

Defendant receives another summons addressed to the XXXX address to appear in Court on XXXX XXXX, 2014 at the request of Plaintiff, without giving an option to XXXX 's circumstances. 

Plaintiff supplied numerous XXXX XXXX Statements and a copy of the Contract prior to XXXX XXXX, 2014, to the Defendant and the Court for viewing as evidence. 
Defendant discovered that the documents had been altered to show the appearance that the Defendant had been receiving these statements in XXXX. 
Defendant has never received any Bank statement documents from XXXX Bank at a XXXX address. 

Defendant has supplied the Court with factual evidence to proof his XXXX residency. To prove that the Plaintiff has filed in the wrong judicial jurisdiction, and case must be dismissed. 

Defendant on XXXX XXXX, 2014 notified the Court and the Plaintiff that the Defendant would not be able to appear on the XXXX XXXX date, due to his XXXX employment obligations. The filing returned address was my XXXX. 

Well the case was heard on XXXX XXXX, 2014, without the presence of the Defendant. The Plaintiff had prepared an Order Judgment document for the Judge to sign at the hearing, and through some persuasion his wishes were granted. Along knowing that he had won the case without having to argue against a Defendant objection. 

WHY WAS THIS CASE HEARD, without giving consideration to a Defendant rights to present some defense. When everyone knew the Defendant was not going to be present. 
What type of "" Dog and Pony '' show was this hearing? 

Defendant has submitted several requests to have this Case Vacated, based on the facts ; that ALL the evidence brought to this Court by the Plaintiff and client XXXX XXXX Bank is false. 
This was just a clever, disrespectful and unlawful attempt to try and show that the Defendant resides in XXXXThe Defendant after receiving the shocking notice of Summary Judgment several months later as it was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded to Defendants legal residency address in XXXX. 

Defendant filed a Dismissal request with the Court and the Plaintiff in XXXX 2014 with a return address receipt showing his XXXX address. 

IF the Defendant is to be held contractually obligated with the XXXX XXXX Card Contract and all its contents that the Plaintiff presented to the Court as evidence. If So ; then the whole contract has to be recognized, not just bits and pieces. 

The Plaintiff should be obligated to follow the Contract agreement under "" Arbitration and Hearings '' and propose a means of arbitration and possible mutual settlement. 

At no time during these proceedings has Arbitration been presented to the Defendant by the Plaintiff or its client XXXX XXXX. Violation of XXXX XXXX 's contract with Defendant.

XXXX concerning XXXX or XXXX debts of the same account that appeared on XXXX public credit reports. I questioned the validity of the debts and the amounts owed. XXXX XXXX PROMISED to mail, to my home address which I provided during the conversation, an official document detailing the amounts owed, the original creditor and a statement guaranteeing that the debt amount would be updated on XXXX credit reports if I paid in full. XXXX XXXX explained that this was an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained would be used for that purpose. I was told the document would be mailed within a few days. Today, XXXX XXXX, 2015, I viewed XXXX public credit reports and noted that the last reported date had been changed from XXXX/XXXX/2011 to XXXX/XXXX/2015. Instead of providing me with an official document or notice that the debt was owed, National Credit Systems Inc. updated their data with XXXX credit reporting agencies as an malicious attempt to place negative data on my credit report for an additional 7 years. The original negative information was scheduled for deletion approximately less than 1 year from the date that I called them to resolve the matter. I have contacted the original creditor prior to contacting National Credit Systems Inc. and was told that they no longer own the debt. My contract is with the original creditor, XXXX. I have no contract with National Credit Systems Inc. and they refuse to provide with any documentation to support their claim of ownership or purchase of the debt. In good faith I was attempting to resolve this matter. I provided my name, address, SSN, date of birth, employer, and both cell phone and home telephone numbers. 

The debt itself is misleading as it appears on XXXX public credit reports. It is documented as owing {$500.00} and then {$3600.00}. There is a third entry showing an amount owed of {$4100.00}. Per XXXX XXXX of National Credit Systems Inc., the full amount owed is actually {$4100.00}. My interpretation based on the manner the debt ( s ) are documented is that I owe someone, a total of {$8200.00}. In my opinion, considering the amount that this collection agency claims I owe them for debt that they intercepted from the original creditor, a letter or formal communication of some sort is not an unreasonable request. If I request an email or regular mail statement in an attempt to pay a debt, there is no reason for the creditor to penalize me and ruin my credit for an additional 7 years. I called them. According to XXXX XXXX, "" we had no way to contact you and the debt would have disappeared within months ''. The tactics used by National Credit Systems Inc. appear to be malicious and unfair in nature in terms of making promises and not following through as well as and most importantly not providing PROOF and descriptions identifying themselves as the actual debt collector and owner. If I had paid in full National Credit Systems Inc. on or about XXXX/XXXX/2015, there would not have been any guarantee that at a later date the original creditor or some other collection agency would not have contacted me claiming ownership of the same debt and demanding payment, therefore starting the process over again.",Company disputes the facts presented in the complaint,"National Credit Systems,Inc.",TN,381XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,09/17/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1568750

2015-08-24,Debt collection,Medical,Communication tactics,Used obscene/profane/abusive language,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I would like to file this complaint against Grant and Weber. The way they have treated me these last 5 months is completely shameful and they have caused me plenty of grief and have left me feeling complete despair. 

I recently found out that there was a judgment on me for my deceased husband 's medical bills. I became real ill because I have no money. My mother saw this and said she would give me money to try and settle this debt. Because of this, these last 5 months I have been attempting to settle this old debt that my deceased husband left me with. Grant and Weber has the judgment against me and my deceased husband. My husband died many years ago and I am XXXX years old and have been living on nothing but social security for many years. I have n't worked in nearly 20 years. The only thing I have left of value is the home my husband left me with. 

5 months ago I initially communicated with an XXXX XXXX about this account and she told me that this judgment was {$11000.00}! Upon hearing this I was mortified. The original amount owed to the hospital was {$4700.00} dollars and even after reviewing the documents there was only {$800.00} in attorney fees. When I spoke with her she said that they wanted {$9500.00} and nothing less. 

Upon hearing this I was distraught. I do n't have any money and I ca n't come up with {$9500.00} so I decided to talk to someone who may be able to assist me. I spoke with an individual named XXXX XXXX who attempted for months to negotiate with Grant and Weber. He spoke with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, another individual named XXXX, and an XXXX XXXX. They kept giving him numbers until XXXX XXXX finally told him {$8500.00} bottom line. Now when he calls they say they do n't even have records of that number. How convenient. 

During these last months I have borrowed money from my mother, from my feonce, and have sold many possessions I held dear just to try and come up with the amount I was told. In the end I came up short. I was only able to acquire {$7200.00}. I have nothing left to give and no one else to ask for money. When my representative called to offer that amount is when things with Grant and Weber got ugly. 

Had Grant and Weber simply said no I would have been OK with it. Distraught but OK with it. What I am not OK with is the things they said. I heard the conversation XXXX XXXX had with the representative and I was appalled at the way XXXX XXXX XXXX dealt with this matter. Truth be told, he was very cordial initially but towards the end he said some very hurtful things. 

In the conversation, XXXX XXXX XXXX implied and then later stated that I could beg for money to pay this bill. As a 64 year old woman living on social security I was very hurt at the notion of being told to beg for money. He also stated that I was offered {$50.00} a month years ago to pay this debt and that is why they would n't lower the amount. That 's not true. Furthermore, he wanted to make an example of me. He stated that they would n't lower the balance because he was "" calling my bluff '' whatever that means. he also stated that "" he does not reward people for not paying promptly. '' He even gave an example of how when people go get a XXXX XXXX credit card you do n't get rewarded for paying late. 

This debt is from my husbands medical bills right before he died. I was solely dependent on him and I do n't have money to pay them with. I do n't know what all the laws for collecting are but you should not be able to belittle people by saying they should beg for money to pay their bills. Also, they should n't be punished now simply because they could n't pay their bills in a timely fashion when they were completely destitute. I understand this may not help me in the settlement, but these people should not be allowed to disrespect and belittle people in their time of need.

We received numerous medical bills and thought we had paid all of them. However, XXXX remained for original creditor, XXXX XXXX, MD, which went to collections in XXXX 2014. The original balance was {$600.00}. My wife was contacted by the debt collection agency, Allied Collection Services, in XXXX, and they advised her that, unless she went into their office within 2 days, they would be forced to take legal action against her. She was understandably upset, so she went into their office, infant in tow, where they convinced her to sign several forms, including setting up a payment plan. She setup the payment auto-debit, according to their terms as they discussed in the office, and they withdrew a couple payments. However, in or around XXXX 2014, Allied filed suit and obtained a judgment against her, claiming she had not honored the terms of the payment arrangement. Upon review of the payment documentation, they required an initial payment of {$50.00} and subsequent payments of {$25.00} per month. My wife was led to believe that she only needed to setup the auto-debit for {$25.00} per month so she "" missed '' the first payment. Upon securing judgment against my wife, Allied Collection Services secured a wage garnishment order against me as well. Upon being advised by my employer of the wage garnishment, my wife contacted Allied Collection Services to attempt to resolve the matter, but they refused to offer any reasonable alternatives ( other than payment in full along with significant additional collection costs ). My wages were garnished until XXXX 2015, at significantly more than {$25.00} a month. At no time did Allied Collection Services ever attempt to contact me prior to, during, or after garnishing my wages, which seemed like a fairly straightforward and simple thing to do. Nevertheless, I did not believe I had any option and allowed the garnishment to proceed. Upon completion, they secured enough money to nearly double the original debt. Further, although Allied had never made any contact with me, or attempted to do so that I am aware, they placed a derogatory tradeline in my credit file, the only such derogatory information in my credit report, and significantly impacting my credit for the next 7 years. I feel it is unconscionable that they were allowed to do as much as they did without first attempting to contact me. It was unconscionable that they created such a false sense of urgency for my wife when they knew full well that they could arrange a payment plan with her over the phone. It was unconscionable that they were so aggressive, so quickly after receiving the collection account, and that they said XXXX thing about the payment plan requirements but embedded different information in the fine print of the documents they pressured my wife to sign. And it is preposterous that I was forced to pay nearly double the original debt, which had not even been with them for 1 month at the time they secured judgment.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"Allied Collection Services, Inc.

The benefit will pay for emergency care rendered for non-service-connected conditions for enrolled veterans who have no other source of payment for the care. However, VA will only pay to the point of medical stability. There are very strict guidelines concerning these types of claims. Veterans and their non-VA providers should be aware that these claims must be filed with the VA within XXXX days from the last day of the emergent care. "" Civilian hospitals are required to notify the nearest VA hospital of an incoming veteran patient within XXXX hours from the time of visit so the VA can either make arrangements for the patient to be transported to the VA facility or to be notified that the veteran can not be transported and they can submit the billing to the VA facility. 
Each time I was taken to the emergency room whether from friend taking me or the ambulance, I told the medical person with me I was a veteran, some instances I was able to walk to the desk and check in, one time I was transported via ambulance, but that time I told the guy in the truck I am a veteran and even had on a wrist band from the VA hospital I was just leaving from ( I was in a car accident on my way home after a follow-up appt from the VA hospital in XXXX after having a XXXX and was nearly home when the car I was in was struck by a speeding vehicle, I never made it home instead I was taken to the nearest hospital in ambulance. 
So, about the bills, I never received any actual bills, instead close to a year after the car accident I received a call from a collection company and asked what bill, they gave me several bills I had in collections, I was not aware of any of them because I always thought the VA was billed initially. I explained to the collection company that I was not supposed to have been billed and they offered me to give the Department of Veterans Affairs info to pay the bills, when I called the VA they told me the bills had to have been submitted within XXXX days. I told the collection company that and they told me that I would have to pay then. They could not care less that I was not supposed to be billed. It has been years that I have been back and fourth with the hospital, collection company, other people the hospital tells me to contact. Nobody will man up and remove the bills from my credit. Instead every person I talk to, simply wants me to pay for someone else 's mistake. The staff I have spoken to are pretty rude for the most part as well, especially at the hospital. 
Please help me to find the responsible party, have them remove this, so I can get on with my life and my family. 
The billing dept from the hospital told me they did contact me via mail and provided a few date but they were not able to verify that I received their bills. They never made a phone call, the only people that contacted me was the collection company XX/XX/XXXX roughly. I called them several times since then but they have never contacted me, nor have the asked me to update my contact information when I call in, even after asking them what address and phone number they have on file.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,"HCFS Health Care Financial Services, Inc.",FL,331XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,08/10/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1489002

Since you now have acquired this inaccurate disputed account. I have never been notified by Jefferson Capital System of this collection action or that I owed the debt. This letter is to inform you that I would like a verification of the debt and your ability to collect this money from me. Under the FDCPA, debt collectors ( collection agencies or CAs ) are required to send you a debt validation notice within 5 days of contacting you to collect a debt. The notice informs you that you have the right to validate/dispute the debt within 30 days of receiving the letter. If you do n't dispute the debt ( or request validation of the debt ) within the 30-day period, the collector has the legal right to assume that you agree the debt is valid. 


Under the FDCPA, I have the right to request a validation of this debt. I request that you prove that I am indeed the party who is contractually obligated to pay off this debt. 

I hope you are aware that reporting any invalidated information to major credit bureaus may constitute defamation of character. In addition, you must also be aware that until you validate this debt, you can not continue collection activities or report this information to the credit bureaus.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) is a federal law that details how consumer credit information can be collected, given out, and used.

THIS notice is sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 USC 1692g Sec. 809 ( b ) that your claim is disputed and validation is requested.

XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Collection agencies are reporting that I owe the above creditor XXXX Car Rental a debt. I am in dispute of this unfair debt collection practice and inaccurate billing dispute. How could I possibly owe XXXX these creditors for the same exact debt? XXXX Re : XXXX Car Rental ) As per this rental, this was an insurance claim, paid in full by my Insurance with : XXXX INSURANCE- PLEASE CHECK YOUR RECORDS CAREFULLY. Upon return of my rental the agent on duty never advised me or called me to discuss with me THAT I HAD A BALANCE/ OR gave me an opportunity to actually DISPUTE the issue. 

I am requesting that you investigate this illegal deceptive practice and verification of this questionable debt collection agency/or agencies. I NEVER RECEIVED ANY NOTIFICATION OF THIS DEBT or a description of what I owe this money for. Apparently this is a scam ; this appears to be the same exact companies. This is an illegal Unfair practices. Debt collectors should not be allowed to engage in unfair practices when they try to collect a debt. For example, in this case, they should not identify themselves as different companies, when they are actually the same. 
Please investigate this matter. I do n't even know who these companies were until this account was turned over for collection. Could it be credit theft? I 'm not paying until I see an accurate billing statement. FUTHERMORE, "" The FTC CLEARY points out, "" Every collector must send CONSUMERS a written 'validation notice ' telling you how much money you owe within five days after they first contact you. This notice also must include the name of the creditor to whom you owe the money, and how to proceed if you do n't think you owe the money. '' I never received any notice. Subsequently, The FCRA also protects consumers from the misreporting of information on your credit report. If a debt collector or credit bureau reports incorrect or inaccurate account information, it is violating the FCRA. Examples of violations include failing to report that a debt was discharged in bankruptcy and reaging old debt to extend the statute of limitations. In this case, it is definitely apparent that a collection agency or Credit bureaus can most definitely mix up similar credit files and misreport information. Therefore a consumer, should have the right to dispute any information he/she may feel is not possibly reported accurately.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"Choice Recovery, Inc.",GA,31412,Older American,Consent provided,Web,07/13/2015,Closed,Yes,No,1463660

2015-06-26,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I 'm not satisfied with Well Fargo 's response concerning this student loan. This loan was opened by my dad several years ago without my knowledge. I discovered the loan was opened in my name 3 years later when applying for a car loan. My dad advised that he would continue to pay on the loan, and not to worry. Never mind the fact that I never received a notice or statement from Wells Fargo concerning this loan prior to me reviewing my credit file. My dad is now retired and due to XXXX is unable to maintain the monthly bill for this loan. 

Although I never agreed to this loan, I do not want to pursue criminal charges against my dad, BUT I do not agree with Wells ' Fargo business practices concerning my dispute about this loan. This loan has gone into default twice and has been reported as 30 days late to my credit bureau. I 've told my dad countless times that if he thinks he is not going to be able to make the payment to contact me before it becomes late so that I can try to cover the payment. However, that has not happened. My mom did let me know that due to my dad being out of work and without a car due to a car accident, that he will not be able to make a payment on time. 

I contacted Wells Fargo today, because I feel that I 'm left out of the loop in terms of when a payment is due, if it 's behind, etc. The only time I 'm made aware that a payment is due, is when it 's already BEHIND!!! How is that fair for a consumer who is only trying to do the right thing by repaying a loan that was never requested by her? Additionally, my request to Wells Fargo was to grant me access to view this account online, so that I do not find myself in the same predicament and wind up with another 30 day late reporting on my credit file. The representative, although pleasant, did not have any options to assist me. She advised me as a co-signer that I do not have access to view the loan online, only the borrower can, and also advised to get a monthly statement, I would have to call in and request it!!! Again how is this fair??? 

I 've come to terms that Wells Fargo is not going to do the right thing and remove my name from this loan, but to not give me all the tools to manage the loan, by granting me online access, which is how I maintain all my other bills, which are paid on time, might I add!!! Then to state I have to call in to request a statement each month is mind-boggling, BUT if a payment is behind, there is no hesitation in reporting this on MY credit file. I feel that this is not only unfair, by unlawful, and it feels they are putting me in a position where I always have to worry about whether this bill is going to be paid on time. It has caused me great stress, and has prevented me from being able to obtain a competitive home loan. With this recent 30 day late on my credit file, my score dropped XXXX pts.!!! 

My request from Wells Fargo at this time is to do the right thing, which would be to remove these 30 day lates from my credit file, since they do not give me the proper tools to manage this loan. I also request that if they are not going to remove my name from this loan that they also grant me access to view and make payments online, and mail monthly statements without me having to request them each month.

When making the telephone call to cancel ( close out ) my BOA credit card I told the woman I talked with that I wanted to sever all contact with BOA. She replied in the affermative that it would be done. Then said that in the event that a charge should appear I want it disregarded and no charge for insufficient funds as my account was closed. She had to talk with her supervisor about this. After this consultation she told me that it was okay. No further activity on my account would occur. I am absolutely positive about this conversation. Am not so sure about the following. 

Sometime thereafter I received a charge from BOA. Believe the charge was for insufficient funds. Believe that I called BOA and told them of the arrangement concerning my account closing. I may have received an additional bill by mail but did not receive any more invoices. 

I assumed that everything had been settled with BOA until I was turned down for a credit card with XXXX XXXX Bank. Got a credit report and found the negative entry from BOA.

A number of years ago, a distant relative established an identity utilizing my middle and last names with alternative residence, identification, and social security information.

About our phone conversation SR # XXXX ( XXXX ), This is XXXX XXXX, eBay Customer Service Supervisor. As what we have discussed about your question in creating a new eBay account. 
You can freely create a new eBay account at the same time our system is designed that if XXXX or more accounts are related to each other then those account will be linked. Since this account ( XXXX ) is currently suspended then this account may be linked to the new account. The bankruptcy filed is not the cause of the suspension it is from the fees. The purpose of the bankruptcy filed was to offset the charge meaning we are prohibited from collecting the money from the account. And because your eBay account was suspended prior to the date you filed for bankruptcy eBay is n't required to reinstate the account.

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I listed a XXXX Kawasaki Ninja for sale on eBay. The terms of the listing agreement were : the buyer would be responsible for vehicle pick-up, deposit of {$1000.00} XXXX within XXXX hours of the close of the auction, and {$1900.00} USD within 7 days of the close of the auction. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I received a notification from eBay that XXXX XXXX XXXX had bought the XXXX Kawasaki Ninja ( license number : XXXX and VIN : XXXX ) for the full amount listed ( {$2900.00} ). XXXX XXXX sent {$1000.00} within an hour after the purchase and then {$2000.00} a few hours later. Both transactions were done using PayPal. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015, XXXX XXXX emailed me his phone number so I could contact him to make arrangements for him to pick up the motorcycle. I called XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2015, and he told me that his address was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX CA XXXX, which is 30 minutes away from my location. XXXX XXXX advised that he would pick up the motorcycle at my house. XXXX XXXX picked up the motorcycle and title document on XXXX XXXX, 2015 at XXXX at my residence, XXXX XXXX, # XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX. On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I called XXXX XXXX and left a voicemail to make sure he made it back to XXXX safely and he responded by text that he already sold the bike to someone else. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I filed a transfer of liability with the DMV to advise that XXXX XXXX purchased the motorcycle. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2015 I received a call from PayPal stating that XXXX XXXX claimed that he did not authorize the credit card transaction and was requesting a chargeback. On XXXX XXXX, 2015, PayPal advised that they disputed the chargeback with XXXX XXXX 's credit card company who had decided in the buyer 's favor. PayPal then advised me that I would be responsible for paying back {$3000.00} USD plus a {$40.00} fee. 

XXXX XXXX took the motorcycle into his possession on XXXX XXXX, 2015. He should be responsible for paying for the motorcycle under the terms stated in the listing agreement. I upheld my duty under the purchase agreement to surrender possession of the motorcycle to XXXX XXXX, so I am entitled to the purchase money listed in the purchase agreement. 

I have provided PayPal with all of the texts XXXX XXXX and I exchanged leading up to and after XXXX XXXX picked up the motorcycle, the transfer of liability that I filed with DMV, and the police report I filed with XXXX Police Department. I have contacted PayPal XXXX a week since XXXX XXXX to resolve the issue. They told me they filed a dispute with the Credit Card company but refused to send me any proof of the decision that was made. I 've also emailed the CEO to resolve the issue, and the account-review representative stated that the transaction was not covered under the Seller Protection Policy. 

PayPal 's User Agreement, Section XXXX, states that vehicles, including motorcycles, are not eligible for reimbursement under PayPal Purchase Protection. PayPal violates its own User Agreement and has refused to take any legal or financial action against the buyer to pay for the transaction through other means, but instead sent my account to collections. 

I will be filing a civil lawsuit against PayPal if they do n't resolve this matter right away. I am asking that PayPal clear the {$3000.00} negative balance on my account and pursue XXXX XXXX for the money he owes.

Payment was demanded by XX/XX/XXXX which had already passed. The notice date was XX/XX/XXXX ; however, we had not received it when we left the country on XXXX XXXX.

The ticket was posted for XXXX. We could have left earlier or later but there was no ticket or we would have returned to XXXX to have the manager deal with it. 
I called and emailed XXXX using information from the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX notice and was not successful in reaching any XXXX.

When I received my XXXX 2012 - XXXX 2012 ( service period ) bill ( approximately XXXX XXXX 2012 ) it stated I had an unpaid balance of {$160.00}, so I paid {$160.00} in cash at the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX. located less than XXXX minutes from my residence. I checked my bill pay first and saw that the payment was sent but the check never cashed ( nearly one month after it was sent ). At that time I was most certain the check was lost and would not be cashed. So I called my bank and cancelled the check ( {$29.00} ), meaning I could make the payment and hopefully avoid a XXXX payment that would lead to extended wait time getting my money back and/or "" having a bad mark on my credit report. I also talked to XXXX XXXX prior to stopping payment on this check and let the agent know so my account could be annotated. I wanted to ensure everything was done well, so again after I made the payment through the service center I called back XXXX XXXX customer service and I was assured by the agent that everything was documented within the system. During that conversation I also learned that the reason my account past due is because my account number was changed from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with a system update. I then updated my bill pay with the new account number ( XXXX etc ... ) and made the remaining balance payment of {$170.00} through my bank account ( totaling {$340.00} on my XXXX statement ). 
Then came time for me to move ( XXXX ) to XXXX XXXX WA. resulting in closing my account XXXX 2012 ( six months later ). I made my last payment before I left XXXX XXXX confident that all was well and good with my account. I even received check dated XXXX XXXX 2012 XXXX {$7.00} XXXX further ensuring that my account was well and good. However, long after I cashed the refund check from XXXX XXXX on my account I received a disturbing collection 's agency letter stating that I had an outstanding balance on my XXXX XXXX account in the amount of {$190.00}. This amount included a {$30.00} return check fee and {$160.00} unpaid balance. I asked the customer service rep, on-line technician how I can get my log-in and password from the internet and was told ( impossible ) because the account is closed. I also have asked the agents to simply review the system notes on my account to clear this matter up but apparently all the posting that the agent promised she added to my account had been purged from the system. I do n't know why a company would attempt to collect a payment for several months after an account is closed in good standing. Especially, when the system history notes ca n't go back that far and fully see the picture of those time periods. 
Note : My suggestion for their office is to leave notes from six months past on accounts or do n't attempt to collect from old customers that have closed their accounts in good standing. After 6 months has past that should be more than enough time for a company to clarify an account especially when it come to a returned check ( I paid my account and cancelled the check because of an account number change in which I had no knowledge of ). When the bill pay check initially came in it had the old account number on it and must have sat in someone 's inbox until after I had already closed my account and the technician notes were purged from my account.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,"MRS BPO, LLC",WA,985XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,05/19/2015,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1377893

Citicard repeatedly told me they did not have any information on my account and to call back later. I continued to call Citicard back repeatedly and continued to receive the same statement. 

Finally, on the XXXX call, I pushed to speak to someone else and was finally turned over to Citicard 's Internal Recovery Dept. At this point, I did not have the time or energy to purse this charge as a fraud as I am in the midst of applying for a mortgage loan. I told the Citicard associate that "" I just want to pay off the debt ( the outstanding balance was minimal, {$260.00} ) so that I could close this issue. '' She told me could pay over the phone, then call back in 15 days to get a zero balance letter. I said I needed the letter sooner, can I call back once the check had cleared. The associate responded yes. 

( BTW- it is ridiculous that I have to initiate a call instead of them automatically sending me the letter once the debt was cleared. ) I validated the payment I made to Citicard cleared my bank and called back 4 days later. I was then told that I could not get a Zero Balance Letter until 15 days had passed from payment. I stated this was NOT what I was told by the Citicard associate who accepted my payment. 

I clearly and specifically asked the associate who took my payment if I could call back once the payment had cleared and get the letter, and she said yes. This morning, I spoke to XXXX associates who refused to send me a letter.

During each phone call ( XXXX in all ) Citicard attempted to collect personal data from me ; phone number, email, place of employement, etc.. I refused each time. But Citicard continued to request that I update their information on file.

My XXXX credit has been damaged due to errors and misinformation given by Sallie Mae loan representatives. As the cosigner on my niece 's student loans, I am requesting a credit reversal of the derogatory information that have stained my credit reports. I 've also discovered that there are thousands of online customer complaints documenting the same errors, inefficiencies and misinformation made by Sallie Mae employees. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke to XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) regarding loan __. I told him that my niece and her family were undergoing economic hardship and that my retired status, along with the care of my Mom placed me in a difficult position in terms of repayment of the loans. XXXX mentioned a forbearance option. I stated to him that my niece and her father had been granted the maximum in forbearances stated by Sallie Mae. He then stated that since the family was still undergoing economic hardship that he would appeal to management for another forbearance, provided that I would pay a {$50.00} fee and give him a financial statement over the phone. I asked if deferment was an option, and he said no because my niece was not in school. I gave him the information, paid the {$50.00} fee, XXXX assured me again that he would do everything he could to get a favorable answer from management regarding the forbearance request and to keep my credit from being negatively affected at XXXX. He said if he was n't able to do it, I would receive a call. I never received any follow up calls stating that the forbearance was not approved. 
On the XXXX of XXXX, I called Sallie Mae 's military division to inquire about additional programs for veterans and it was there that I was told that the forbearance that XXXX had processed was denied and the derogatory information was reported to the credit bureaus. The representative said that XXXX should have told me that it was not likely that another forbearance would be granted because of the XXXX opportunities had been exhausted. I also discovered that with the approved forbearance in the past, that Sallie Mae never went back to re-adjust the days past due and those were also on my credit reports. I paid the {$50.00} in good faith and was misinformed and disregarded. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, my niece and her father called and spoke with XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) to request a forbearance for loan__. XXXX took their financial information and said that he would push for a 60-day forbearance, however he could n't guarantee it but would work hard to get it approved. They called back after not hearing from Sallie Mae on that day and was told by a Sallie Mae assistant that nothing was done yet. They were then transferred back to the forbearance department and XXXX took the call and said that everything had been take care of and that someone would call.
